1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,351
<i>This man is worth $500,</i>

2
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>and this man's going to collect.</i>

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,393
<i>He's Jake Cahill,</i>

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,192
<i>and he lives by...</i>

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Bounty Law.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,951
You don't ever bring them in alive,
do you, Jake?

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,713
Not when there's three of them
and one of me.

8
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,752
What are you looking at,
bounty killer?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,356
I'm looking at an ugly owl-hoot
about to get his jaw busted.

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,990
Amateurs try and take men in alive.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,394
- Amateurs usually don't make it.
<i>- Whether you're dead or alive,</i>

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,918
<i>you're just a dollar sign
to Jake Cahill on</i> Bounty Law.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,037
<i>Thursdays at 8:30, only on NBC.</i>

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,078
Hello, everybody.

15
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:29,076
This is Allen Kincade on the set of the exciting hit
NBC and Screen Gems television series <i>Bounty Law.</i>

16
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,198
Now, if you think you're seeing double,
don't adjust your television sets

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,596
because, well, in a way, you are.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,959
To my right is <i>Bounty Law</i> series lead
and Jake Cahill himself, Rick Dalton.

19
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,793
And to my left is Rick's stunt double,
Cliff Booth.

20
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,713
Welcome, gentlemen, and thanks
for taking the time to visit with us.

21
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,153
Well, it's our pleasure, Allen.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,519
So, Rick, explain to the audience
exactly what it is a stunt double does.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,959
Well...

24
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,111
actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,194
Say Jake Cahill gets shot off his horse.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,510
Now, can I fall off a horse?

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,155
Yes, I can, and, yes, I have.

28
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,877
But say I fall off wrong and I sprain
my wrist or I twist my ankle.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,519
Now, that can put an undue burden on production
because now maybe I can't work for a week.

30
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,353
So Cliff here is meant
to help carry the load.

31
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,829
Is that how you'd describe
your job, Cliff?

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,117
What, carrying his load? Yeah,
that's about right.

33
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,836
Join me next week on the set of
<i>The Dick Van Dyke Show,</i>

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,436
where I'll be talking to those comical
cutups, Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,069
Till then, this is Allen Kincade
signing off from Hollywood.

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,793
I missed you.

37
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,311
- The black one. And the flowers.
- Flowers, Ava, flowers.

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,234
- And there's the small one.
- Can I see your tickets?

39
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,276
Oh, good boy.

40
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,839
Gina, Gina, Gina.

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,639
The face in the misty light.

42
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,713
- Hello, Mr. Schwarz.
- Hello, Gina.

43
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,874
I, uh... I have a meeting with
a very handsome cowboy man.

44
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,519
He's waiting for you in the bar.

45
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,233
Well...

46
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,394
since I just finished watching
a Rick Dalton fucking film festival,

47
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,199
I think I know who you are. Put it there.

48
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,795
Well, it's my pleasure, Mr. Schwartz.

49
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,954
- And thank you for taking an interest.
- Schwarz, not Schwartz.

50
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,350
Goddamn it to hell. I'm sorry about that.

51
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,557
- It's my pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.
- Call me Marvin.

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,278
Marvin, call me Rick.

53
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,278
- Rick?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,795
- Oh, is that your son? Ha-ha.
- My son?

55
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,792
No, that's my stunt double, Cliff Booth.

56
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,314
- Yeah.
- Good to meet you.

57
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,471
We've worked together
since the last two seasons of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

58
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,154
- Yeah?
- My car's in the shop, so he gave me a ride.

59
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
<i>That's a big fucking lie.</i>

60
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,391
<i>Rick got his driver's license taken away
for too many drunk-driving tickets.</i>

61
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,755
<i>- Cliff drives him everywhere now.</i>
- Oh, fuck.

62
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,798
- Well, sounds like a good friend.
- I try.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,711
I wanna send you greetings from my wife,
Mary Alice Schwarz.

64
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,439
Oh, well, that's nice.

65
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,029
Thanks a lot.

66
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,639
We had a Rick Dalton double feature
in our screening room last night.

67
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,636
Oh, well, that's both flattering
and embarrassing.

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
What'd you see?

69
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:43,079
Thirty-five mm prints of <i>Tanner</i>
and <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,511
I hope the, uh, Rick Dalton double feature

71
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,792
wasn't too painful for you and the...
And the missus.

72
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,920
Oh, no. "Painful." Stop. What are you saying?

73
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,115
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.
Our whole courtship, we watched Westerns.</i>

74
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,838
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,115
<i>And we thoroughly enjoyed</i> Tanner.

76
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,790
- Oh, that's nice.
- It's really good. And anyway, she goes to bed.

77
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,954
<i>I open up a box of Havanas.</i>

78
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,473
<i>I light up,
I pour myself a cognac and I watch...</i>

79
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,512
<i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,795
What a picture.

81
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,632
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

82
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,557
That is so much fun.

83
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,639
All the shooting.

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,516
- I love that stuff. You know, the killing.
- A lot of killing. Lot of killing, yeah.

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,310
Now, gentlemen, the plan
is, we reverse our forces

86
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,034
<i>und</i> drive the Allies back into the sea!

87
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,034
- Genius.
- Panzer divisions come in,

88
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,918
and we drive them here to the ocean.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,433
They'll be up against the wall.

90
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,512
- They will have nowhere to go.
- Yes.

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,079
This is the spot...

92
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Hermann!

93
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,519
Open the curtains.

94
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,192
Anybody order fried sauerkraut?!

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,515
Burn, you Nazi bastards! Ha-ha-ha!

96
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,510
That's you operating the
flamethrower, isn't it?

97
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,557
Oh, you bet your sweet ass it was.
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,477
- It was you?
- Yeah. And let me tell you,

99
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,076
that's one shit-fuck crazy weapon
you do not wanna be on the wrong side of.

100
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,275
Boy, oh, boy.

101
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,318
You know, I practiced with that dragon, uh,

102
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,351
three hours a day for two weeks.

103
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,876
Not just because I wanted to look good
in the picture, but because I was...

104
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,076
I was shit-scared of the damn
thing, to be honest.

105
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,639
Mike fucking Lewis!

106
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,312
Crisping them Nazis to hell!

107
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,958
Oh, shit, that's...

108
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,710
All right, that's too hot.
Anything we can do about that heat?

109
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,474
- Rick, it's a flamethrower.
- Yeah.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,913
So I came to the office early today,

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,480
and I watched two episodes
of <i>Bounty Law</i> on 16 mm.

112
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,437
Jody Janice,

113
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,389
wanted for cattle rustling in the
state of Wyoming, $425 dead or alive.

114
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,754
And you brought him here to collect.

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,515
I don't even know where here is.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,716
It was just the closest place.

117
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,634
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

118
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,153
So, bounty killer,

119
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,557
the name of this town is Janicetown.

120
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,278
And that boy you killed...

121
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,109
was Jody Janice.

122
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,839
He was the baby boy of
Major Nathin Maxwell Janice.

123
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,754
Who's Major Nathin Maxwell Janice?

124
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,275
Well, I'll be sure and introduce you

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,634
when he gets here.

So you've been doing guest shots

136
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,874
on episodic TV shows the
last couple of years?

137
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,797
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm doing a pilot for CBS right now.

138
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,389
It's called... It's called <i>Lancer.</i>
I play the heavy.

139
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,039
Did a, ahem, Ron Ely <i>Tarzan.</i>

140
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,078
I did a <i>Land of the Giants. Green Hornet.</i>

141
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,072
I did that show, uh...

142
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,471
<i>Bingo Martin</i> with that kid Scott Brown. Yeah.

143
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,876
And I got a <i>F.B.I.</i> that airs this Sunday.

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,432
You... You always play the
bad guy on these shows?

145
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

146
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,354
So, and they have a fight
scene at the end of them?

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,514
Well, not... Not...
Not <i>Land of the Giants</i> or <i>F.B.I.,</i>

148
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,558
- but the rest, yeah. Yeah.
- And you lose in the fight?

149
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,351
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm... I'm the heavy.

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,639
Oh, that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

151
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,269
- Now, you take <i>Bingo Martin,</i> for example. Right?
- Mm-hm.

152
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,828
So you got a new guy like Scott Brown.

153
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,432
You wanna build up his bona fides, right?

154
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,433
So you hire a guy from a
canceled show to play the heavy.

155
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,711
Then at the end of the show, when they fight,

156
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,677
it's hero besting heavy.

157
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,274
But what the audience sees

158
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,394
is Bingo Martin whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

159
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,515
- You see?
- Mm-hm.

160
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,397
Then next week, it's Ron Ely.

161
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,836
And next week, it's Bob Conrad,

162
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,879
wearing his tight pants, kicking your ass.

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

164
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,152
In another couple of years, playing punching
bag to every swinging dick new to the network,

165
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,837
that's gonna have a psychological effect
on how the audience perceives you.

166
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,399
Right.

167
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,357
So, Rick,

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,274
who's gonna kick the shit
out of you next week?

169
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,352
Mannix? The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

170
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,437
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

171
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,837
How about Batman and Robin?

172
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,436
Ping! Pow! Choom! Zoom!

173
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,788
Down goes you.

174
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,873
Down goes your career as a leading man.

175
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,274
Or do you go to Rome and star in Westerns

176
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,591
and win fucking fights?

177
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,799
Ticket, señor?

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,958
- All right, what's the matter, partner?
- Well...

179
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,557
it's official, old buddy.

180
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,633
- I'm a has-been.
- What are you talking about?

181
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,037
- What did that guy tell you?
- He told me the goddamn truth, is what he told me.

182
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,034
Whoa, whoa.

183
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

184
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,474
- I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that.
- Here. Put these on.

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,676
- Don't cry in front of the Mexicans.
- Son of a bitch.

186
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,956
Now, what's got you so upset, man?

187
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,192
If coming face-to-face with the failure
that is your career ain't worth crying about,

188
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,320
- then I don't know what the fuck is.
- Right. That guy in there turn you down?

189
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,235
No. He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

190
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,073
- Then what's the problem?
- I gotta do Italian goddamn movies!

191
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,913
- That's the fucking problem!
- Come on.

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,197
Fucking bullshit!
It doesn't matter whether I cry in public.

193
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,596
Nobody remembers who the
fuck I am anyway, huh?

194

Five years of ascent. Pfft.

222
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,029
Ten years of treading water.

223
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,879
And now a race to the bottom. Heh.

224
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,510
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of,

225
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,876
so I can't say I really know how you feel.

226
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,269
What are you talking about?
You're my stunt double.

227
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,918
Come on, now. Shit.

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,390
Rick, I'm your driver, man. I'm your gofer.

229
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,075
I'm not complaining, man.
I like driving you around.

230
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,832
I like doing shit around the house

231
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,719
and house-sitting in the
Hollywood Hills when you're gone.

232
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,870
But I haven't been a full-time
stuntman for a while now,

233
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,000
and from where I'm standing, going to
Rome to star in movies does not sound

234
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,639
like the fate worse than death
that you seem to think it is.

235
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,192
Come on, now.
You ever seen an Italian Western, huh?

236
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,397
They're awful. It's a fucking farce.

237
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,039
Yeah, how many you seen? One? Two?

238
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,559
I've seen enough, all right?
Nobody likes Spaghetti Westerns.

239
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,671
Oh, hell, man, stay in L.A.
Give it what fer next pilot season.

240
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,911
Nah, nah. I'm... I'm...

241
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,152
I'm too insecure now to
score come pilot season.

242
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,118
Besides, Screen Gems ain't gonna
have nothing good to say about me.

243
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,509
- You know that.
- Shit. You made <i>Bounty Law.</i>

244
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,037
Nobody's gonna forgive me
for that last season. No matter what I do,

245
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,710
I'm always gonna be the horse's ass
that got <i>Bounty Law</i> canceled

246
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,395
because I wanted some fucking
rinky-dink movie career.

247
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,355
Tom. My friend.

248
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,271
- I met him?
- No, you haven't met him.

249
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,471
- You won't meet him because I don't think you'd like him.
- Why?

250
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,157
Well...

251
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,836
- Don't even joke.
- A joke? But they're scared.

252
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,877
Holy shit. Heh.

253
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,558
That was Polanski.

254
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,199
That was Roman Polanski.

255
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,035
He's lived there for a month now.
First time I seen him.

256
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,152
Holy shit. Goddamn it.

257
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,193
What do I always say?
Most important thing in this town is,

258
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,635
when you're making money,
you buy a house in town.

259
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,400
You don't rent. Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

260
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,631
Hollywood real estate means you live here.

261
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,111
You're not just visiting,
not just passing through.

262
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,270
You fucking live here.

263
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,148
Here I am flat on my ass,
and who I got living next door to me?

264
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,392
The director of <i>Rosemary's</i> fucking
<i>Baby,</i> that's who.

265
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,677
Polanski, the hottest director in
town right now, probably the world.

266
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,069
He's my next-door fucking neighbor.
Heh-heh.

267
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,159
I mean, shit.
I mean, who knows what could happen?

268
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,836
I could... I could be one pool party away
from starring in a new Polanski movie.

269
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,230
- So you're feeling better now?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry about all that.

270
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,108
- Give me my glasses back.
- Oh, come get them, fucker. Come...

271
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,431
All right, all right, Audie Murphy, relax.

272
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,954
- There you go.
- You gonna need me for anything else?

273
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,952
Nah, nah, nah. I got a lot of
lines to learn for tomorrow.

274
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,240
- Shit. All right.
- All right.

275
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,311
- I'm gonna get my carcass on home.
- All right.

276
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,631
- All right, 7:15 a.m.
- Seven-fifteen.

277
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,518
- Out the door.
- Out the door.

278
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,796
- In the car.
- All right, see you then.

279
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,593
Hello, coming in. Hello.

280
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,717
Hello, darling. Hello.

281
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,679
Come here.

282
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,318
Hello, sweetheart.

283
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,829
How was your day?

284
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,152
Wait till you see what I got for you.

285
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,630
Wait until you see what I got for you.

286
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,676
Look what I got for you.

287
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,711
Gonna blow your mind, man.

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,837
Ho-ho-ho! Come here. Come here.

289
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,634
Was that a whine?

290
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,632
What did I tell you about whining?
You whine, you don't eat.

291
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,837
I will throw this shit in the trash.
I don't wanna, but I will.

292
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
You understand?

293
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,109
All right.

294
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,592
<i>I waited at the bar till closing
time, but he never came back.</i>

295
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,958
<i>Okay, Peggy, what happened?</i>

296
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,680
<i>I don't know. Everything was fine.</i>

297
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,240
<i>We had dinner at my house.</i>

298
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,797
<i>- And afterwards, you know, while I was doing the dishes,</i>
- Tsk, tsk.

299
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,552
<i>he and Tobey played.</i>

300
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,473
<i>And then, at the club, Gabe was doing great.</i>

301
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,711
<i>Then, wham, a sudden change.</i>

302
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,076
<i>You know how musicians are.
They're temperamental cats.</i>

303
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,270
<i>- Who knows what got into him?</i>
- Yeah.

<i>Rick Dalton
rehearsal tape starting in five, four,</i>

305
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,359
<i>three, two, one.</i>

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,798
Pepe, get your behind behind that bar!
I got a guest.

307
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,359
<i>Johnny says...</i>

308
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,352
<i>Spanish, Spanish, Spanish.</i>

309
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,108
<i>- How's the beans?</i>
- I've had worse.

310
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,269
<i>Johnny says... Spanish.</i>

311
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,919
<i>A toast.</i>

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,434
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

313
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,317
May they never meet.

314
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,509
Señor Madrid, care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

315
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,958
<i>I would be delighted, Monsieur Dakota.</i>

316
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:46,710
Take the bottle with you.

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,510
<i>And Pepe comes over.</i>

318
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,919
Hey, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours with the fiddle?

319
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,440
<i>She's asleep.</i>

320
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,838
Well, wake her the heck up, get her down here with
her fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guests.

321
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,596
<i>Sí, señor, but please don't
hurt her this time, I beg you.</i>

322
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,151
I ain't gonna hurt her.
Just want her to play the fiddle.

323
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,070
Fetch her and tell her I'll give her a fat $5 gold
piece, she play her little chili pepper heart out.

324
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,592
So, Johnny, what else you heard about me?

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,117
<i>I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard, but Lancer has money.</i>

326
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,114
<i>At some point,
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.</i>

327
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,240
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

328
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,516
I'll open the door for you.

329
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,715
You look good.

330
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,990
- I think Steve's gonna be there too.
- Oh, yeah.

331
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,079
Oh, look. They're here.

332
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,318
Welcome to Playboy Mansion, Mr. Polanski.

333
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,438
Hey, how are you doing, baby?

334
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,989
Hey! How are you?

335
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,555
Oh, Cass!

336
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Yeah!

337
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,993
Yeah, baby!

338
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,559
Yeah!

339
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,038
Oh, yeah.

340
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,479
I'm gonna tell you a story.

341
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,679
She was engaged to him.

342
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,914
Then she flew to the UK...

343
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,236
to make a film with him,

344
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,269
and broke off her engagement
with him and married him.

345
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,035
Then they moved to Los Angeles,

346
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,829
and the three of them have been inseparable.

347
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,950
Really?

348
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,269
What's up?

349
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,756
Jay loves Sharon, that's what's up.

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,069
And he knows...

351
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,075
as sure as God made little green apples...

352
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,999
that one of these days,
that Polish prick's gonna fuck things up,

353
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,789
and when he does, Jay's gonna be there.

354
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,155
Well, one thing's for sure.

355
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,959
Yeah?

356
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,269
What's that?

357
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:01,272
Sharon absolutely has a type.

358
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,313
Cute, short, talented guys who
look like 12-year-old boys.

359
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,390
Yeah.

360
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,592
I never stood a chance.

361
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,276
Fuck you, Dr. Sapirstein.

362
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,552
Oh, here we are.

363
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:48,513
Tell transpo!
Gonna need to move all that out!

364
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,119
Just a sec. Hold on, guys.

365
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,117
Go ahead.

366
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,536
- Maybe you can talk to him.
- Just talk to him.

367
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,119
- Get that set in place.
- Hey.

368
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,395
Ahem. I think the wind blew down
my TV antenna last night,

369
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,911
so while I piss-fart around with wardrobe,
you mind going home and fixing it?

370
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,072
I can. Can you talk to the
stunt gaffer about me today?

371
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,152
- That way I'll know if I'm working this week or not.
- Yeah.

372
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,679
I've been meaning to tell you.

373
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,913
The guy who gaffs this,
he's best friends with Randy,

374
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,436
the gaffer from <i>The Green Hornet,</i>
so there really ain't no point.

375
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,469
Well, if you don't need me,
I'll pick you up at wrap.

376
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,791
I don't need you. Not today.

377
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,117
Go home, fix my antenna, do whatever.
See you at wrap.

378
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Hey!

379
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,831
You're Rick fucking Dalton.
Don't you forget it.

380
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,070
Hey, hey.

381
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,358
Hey, buddy, I'm Rick Dalton.
You know where I'm supposed to go?

382
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,320
- They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer.
- Where's the makeup trailer?

383
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,516
Straight back the way you came, hard right.

384
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,833
Oh, my God.

385
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,673
Rick Dalton.

386
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,074
Sam Wanamaker.

387
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,951
Hey, Sam. Sorry about the wet hand.

388
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,635
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm used to it with Yul.

389
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,277
I just want you to know, I'm the one who cast you,
and I could not be more delighted you're doing this.

390
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,148
Oh, well, thank you, Sam. I...
I appreciate it. It's a good part.

391
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,152
- Yeah, it is. Have you met Jim Stacy, the series lead?
- Uh...

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,518
- Not yet, no. No.
- Well, you guys are going to be dynamite together.

393
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,990
Mm. Mm. Well, it sounds exciting.

394
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,197
Yeah, lightning in a bottle.

395
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,318
- Now, you met Sonya, makeup and hair?
- Hi.

396
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,360
- And this is Rebekka, who does costumes.
- Hello.

397
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,358
- Hi.
- Howdy.

398
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,351
I want a whole new look for Caleb.

399
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,557
I don't want this Western costumed
the way they costumed <i>The Big Valley</i>

400
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,949
and <i>Bonanza</i> for the last decade.

401
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:03,679
I want a zeitgeist flair to the costumes.

402
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:11,077
I mean, nothing anachronistic,
but where does 1869 and 1969 meet?

403
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,914
Especially when it comes to you, Caleb.

404
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,072
- Mm. Mm.
- First off, I want to give him a mustache.

405
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:21,916
A big, droopy, Zapata-like mustache.

406
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,036
Now, about his jacket.

407
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,038
I want to give him a hippie jacket.

408
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,311
Something he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

409
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,278
- and look like the hippest guy in the room.
- Far out.

410
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,512
We got a Custerjacket.
Fringes all down the arm.

411
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,516
It's tan now, but I dye it dark brown,
he could hit the Strip in it tonight.

412
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,637
That's my girl.

413
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,672
- Now, Rick, about your hair.
- What about my hair?

414
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,228
I want to go with a different hairstyle.

415
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,518
- What?
- Something more hippie-ish.

416
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,876
You... You... You...
You want me to look like a hippie?

417
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,998
Well, think less hippie, more...

418
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,514
Hells Angel!

419
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,775
- Right. Say, Sam...
- Get me the...

420
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,028
Sam. Sam, uh...

421
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,632
if you got me covered up in all this...

422
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,998
This junk, how's the
audience gonna know it's me?

423
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,429
- I hope they don't.
- Mm.

424
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't want them to see Jake Cahill.

425
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,878
I want them to see Caleb.

426
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,873
I hired you to be an actor, Rick.

427
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,157
Not a TV cowboy. You're better than that.

428
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,509
<i>I've been meaning to tell
you, the guy who gaffs this,</i>

429
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,672
<i>he's best friends with Randy,
the gaffer from</i> The Green Hornet,

430
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,911
<i>so there really ain't no point.</i>

431
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,755
Hey, Randy.

432
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,079
Cliff.

433
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,510
- So you're still with Rick, huh?
- Still here.

434
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,315
- He in there?
- Yeah. Just knock.

435
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,239
Look, just put him in the
wardrobe, all right?

436
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,199
What's it gonna hurt?
Then if you need him, you got him, all right?

437
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,795
But then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

438
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,349
and, man, she's a fucking bitch.
I just don't... Please, I...

439
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,432
Look, Randy,
I'm asking you to help me out, man.

440
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,911
If the answer's no, the answer's
no, not no with excuses.

441
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Hey, man.

442
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,797
This ain't a fucking Andy
McLaglen picture, you know?

443
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,394
I can't afford to hire a bunch
of guys to smoke cigarettes

444
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,268
and sit around talking to each other all day
on the chance that I might use them.

445
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,400
I got a four-man team here, Rick. If I need
more than that, I gotta get it approved.

446
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,949
And, you know, I gotta look after my dudes.

447
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,992
Hey, and if your dudes
were a better match for me,

448
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,233
I'd say, "Okay, you got me,"
but that's not the case, and you know it.

449
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,311
- He's a great fucking match for me.
- Yeah, no...

450
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,791
Hey, you could do anything you want to him.
Shit, throw him off a building, right?

451
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,759
Light him on fire.
Hit him with a fucking Lincoln, right?

452
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,197
Get creative. Do whatever you want.
He's just happy for the opportunity.

453
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
- Rick.
- Yeah?

454
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,755
I don't dig him.

455
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,431
And I don't dig the vibe he brings on a set.

456
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,159
What, is there some old
beef between the two of you?

457
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,590
- Oh, come on, man.
- What? What?

458
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,911
The dude killed his fucking wife.

459
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,197
Come on, man. You don't
believe that old shit, do you?

460
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,952
Yes, Rick, I do.

461
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,271
And I work with my wife, and she believes it.

462
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,396
She doesn't want his creepy ass around.

463
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,590
You know, this is probably
the shittiest weather ever.

464
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:04,920
The shittiest weather on the shittiest boat
with the shittiest person.

465
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,791
Natalie, my sister, said, "He's a loser.
He's a loser."

466
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,237
They all said it, "He's a fucking loser,"
and I didn't believe them.

467
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,157
So I guess I'm the fucking idiot.

468
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,079
And now you're not gonna talk to me?

469
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,516
What, you don't feel like fighting?

470
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,273
Well, I feel like fucking fighting

471
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,197
because I've been up here by myself for four
hours on this fucking shithole of a boat.

472
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:29,559
Yeah.

473
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,273
He's a goddamn war hero. Fuck.

474
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:38,835
Yeah, appreciate it.

475
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,353
Okay, you fucking horse's ass.
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

476
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,436
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,
but you don't stunt, I don't pay you.

477
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:58,518
Appreciate the opportunity, Randy.
I won't let you down.

478
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,798
- You know my wife Janet, don't you?
- Yeah.

479
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,108
Steer clear of her.

480
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,478
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

481
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,190
What I admire is, in his sport,
there's an element of true combat.

482
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,235
When Cassius Clay meets Sonny Liston in the
ring, that's not two athletes posturing.

483
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,231
That's combat.

484
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,518
Two men trying to kill each other right now.

485
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,795
If you don't beat him...

486
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,994
he kills you.

487
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,639
That's beyond athletics.

488
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:33,315
That's beyond <i>Wide World of Sports,</i> you know?

489
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,989
That's two warriors engaged in combat.
That's what I admire.

490
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,719
In martial arts tournaments,
they won't let you fight like that.

491
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,235
It's very frustrating.

492
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,358
You stand in front of a guy,
and you just wanna let him have it.

493
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,273
But you can't.

494
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,320
So you gotta do this
playacting, patty-cake version.

495
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,552
Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston. Joe Louis.

496
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,313
The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.

497
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,719
They do what they need to do to win.

498
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,197
They unleash as much punishment as
they have to to defeat the other guy.

499
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,559
But in martial arts tournaments,
I do to win what they do to win.

500
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:16,030
I unleash all my power.

501
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,673
I kill people.

502
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,070
If you fought Cassius Clay, who would win?

503
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,914
Well, that would never happen.

504
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,639
But if you did,
what do you think would happen?

505
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,199
I'd make him a cripple.

506
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,239
Hey, you. What's your name?

507
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,117
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

508
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,599
My name's Cliff.

509
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:42,751
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

510
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,594
- Stuntman?
- Yeah.

511
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,076
You know,
you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.

512
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,992
That's what they tell me.

513
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,311
So did I say something funny, stuntman?

514
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,431
- Yeah, you kind of did.
- What's so funny?

515
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,871
Look, I don't want any trouble.
I'm just here to do a job.

516
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,431
But you're laughing at what I'm saying.
But I'm not saying anything funny.

517
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,273
So, what do you think is so funny?

518
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:09,639
What I think is...

519
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,313
you're a little man with a
big mouth and a big chip,

520
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,072
and I think you should be embarrassed

521
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:22,076
to suggest you'd be anything more than a
stain on the seat of Cassius Clay's trunks.

522
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,231
Brother, you're the one with the big mouth.

523
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,951
And I would really enjoy closing it,
especially in front of all my friends.

524
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,396
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

525
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,875
That means, we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you, I go to jail.

526
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,952
Anybody accidentally kills anybody
in a fight, they go to jail.

527
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,590
It's called manslaughter. And I think
all that "lethal weapon" horseshit

528
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,230
is just an excuse so you dancers
never have to get in a real fight.

529
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
Okay.

530
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,916
How about a friendly contest?

531
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,036
No punching in the face.

532
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,679
Two out of three.

533
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,831
Who puts who on the ground first?

534
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,199
Nobody tries to hurt nobody,
just who ends up on their butt?

535
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,478
That's a great idea, Kato.

536
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,391
- You know, Bruce, that guy's kind of famous.
- That guy?

537
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,880
For what?

538
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,394
Killed his wife and got away with it.

539
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,630
That guy?

540
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,789
That guy.

541
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,280
Not bad, Kato.

542
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:04,755
Try that again.

543
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,989
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

544
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,269
What the fuck is going on here?

545
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,592
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.
What the fuck are you thinking?

546
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,911
You're right, Janet. I'm sorry about that.

547
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,639
Don't fucking "Janet" me, you prick.

548
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:02,996
Hey. What's up, babe?

549
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:06,436
What's up, Randy, is that your loser asshole,

550
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:10,355
wife-killing buddy boy here was beating
the shit out of Bruce.

551
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
What?

552
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,434
- Hey, Randy.
- Cliff.

553
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:15,318
What the fuck, man?

554
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,197
Let me just say,
nobody beat the shit out of Bruce.

555
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,510
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

556
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,956
I think that dent in the car
says something different.

557
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,871
Oh, my God!

558
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,429
What the fuck did you do to my car?!

559
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:32,670
What the fuck did you do to her car?

560
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,829
I threw this little prick into it,
but I did not know it was her car.

561
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,436
Get the wardrobe off,
get your shit, and get fucked!

562
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,519
- Janet!
- What?

563
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,592
- I will handle this.
- Then fucking handle it, Randy.

564
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Cliff...

565
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,074
get the wardrobe off, get your
shit, and get off the lot.

566
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:58,679
Fair enough.

567
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:34,518
Aww. What's the matter?

568
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,628
Are you afraid I'll tell Jim Morrison you
were dancing to Paul Revere and the Raiders?

569
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:43,677
Are they not cool enough for you?

570
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:55,038
Who's this shaggy asshole?

571
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:58,755
Hello? Can I help you?

572
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,594
Oh, yeah. Hey, man. I'm looking for Terry.

573
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:04,797
I'm a friend of Terry's and Dennis Wilson's.

574
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,668
Well, Terry and Candy don't live here anymore.
This is the Polanski residence now.

575
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,592
Really? He moved?

576
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
Dang.

577
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,911
You know...? You know where?

578
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,114
I'm not sure, really, but the owner of the
property, Paul, might. He's in the guest house.

579
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,949
Who is it, Jay?

580
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,760
It's okay, honey. It's a friend of Terry's.

581
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,038
- Yeah, just take the back path.
- Thank you kindly.

582
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,119
Ma'am.

583
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,596
- All right, that's an hour!
- Hey, Rick.

584
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,032
I know theyjust broke for lunch, but you need
to wait at least an hour before you can eat.

585
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,998
- Give that glue a chance to dry.
- Oh, no worries, honey.

586
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:03,757
I got my book.
Say, say, where's the bad-guy saloon?

587
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,231
You just go straight through the Western town, take
a right and a left, and you see it right there.

588
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,233
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah, that's better. That's better. Yeah.

589
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,396
Can we move to number two?

590
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,233
How is his bounce?

591
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,635
Can I get a bounce there?

592
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,916
Just grab the crescent
wrench, come right back.

593
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,514
Just make it a quick one.

594
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,309
- Tim!
- Looks great. Right there.

595
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,199
Hello.

596
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Hello.

597
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,599
Hello.

598
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,195
Would it bother you if I sat next to you
and read my book too?

599
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,599
I don't know.

600
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,309
Would you bother me?

601
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,713
I'll try not to.

602
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:40,230
Sit.

603
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
Bleh.

604
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,391
Sorry. Sorry about that.

605
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:37,994
You don't eat lunch?

606
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,556
I've got a scene after lunch.

607
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:42,639
Yeah?

608
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:47,510
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

609
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,719
I believe it's the job of an actor...
And I say "actor," not "actress,"

610
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,634
because the word "actress" is nonsensical.

611
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,157
It's the actor's job to avoid
impediments to their performance.

612
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:03,871
It's the actor's job to strive
for 100 percent effectiveness.

613
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,556
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit...

614
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,909
that's meaningful.

615
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,639
- Who are you?
- You can call me Marabella.

616
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,474
Mar... Marabella what?

617
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:19,119
Marabella Lancer.

618
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,476
No, no, come on, come on.
What's your real name?

619
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,634
When we're on set, I'd prefer to only
be referred to by my character's name.

620
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,878
It helps me invest in
the reality of the story.

621
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,552
I've tried it both ways, and I'm always just a
tiny bit better when I don't break character.

622
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,235
And if I can be a tiny bit
better, I want to be.

623
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,398
You're the bad guy. Caleb DeCoteau.

624
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,356
I thought it was pronounced Caleb "Dakota."

625
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,155
I'm pretty sure it's "DeCoteau."

626
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,036
- DeCoteau.
- Mm-hm.

627
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,396
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

628
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,199
Hm.

629
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,233
What are you reading?

630
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,028
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

631
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,759
It's fascinating.

632
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,717
He's a genius, you know.

633
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,237
I mean, a once-in-every-50-or-100-years
kind of genius.

634
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,719
What are you, 12?

635
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,429
I'm 8.

636
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,668
What are you reading?

637
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,954
Just a Western.

638
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,032
What does that mean? Is it good?

639
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:51,157
- Pretty good.
- What's the story?

640
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,233
I haven't finished it yet.

641
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,472
I didn't ask for the whole story.

642
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,353
What's the idea of the story?

643
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,994
Well...

644
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,596
it's about this guy who's a bronco buster.

645
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,637
It's the story of his life.

646
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,713
Guy's name is Tom Breezy,

647
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,871
but everyone always calls him Easy Breezy.

648
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,599
Now, when Easy Breezy was in his 20s

649
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:20,717
and young and good-looking,

650
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,110
he could break any horse
that you could throw at him.

651
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:27,112
Back then, he just had a way.

652
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:33,271
Now he's into his late 30s and he takes
a bad fall, and it messes up his hip.

653
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,275
He's not... He's not... He's not
crippled or anything like that, but...

654
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,797
But he's got spine problems he never
had before, and he spends, uh...

655
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,389
more of his days in pain
than he ever did before.

656
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,789
Jeepers, this sounds like a good novel.

657
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,635
Yeah, it's not bad.

658
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,474
Where are you in it?

659
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,829
About midway.

660
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,030
What's happening to Easy Breezy now?

661
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,838
He's, um... He...

662
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,552
He's not the best anymore.

663
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,717
In fact, far from it. And...

664
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,235
he's coming to terms with what
it's like to be slightly more...

665
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,400
use...

666
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,190
Slightly more useless each day.

667
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,271
It's okay, Caleb.

668
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,952
It's okay.

669
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:56,474
It sounds like a really sad book.

670
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,516
Poor Easy Breezy.

671
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:01,114
I'm practically crying and
I haven't even read it.

672
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,510
- About 15 years, you'll be living it.
- What?

673
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,594
Nothing, pumpkin puss. I'm just...

674
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,153
I'm just teasing you.

675
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,079
You know something? You, uh...

676
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,474
You might be right about this book.

677
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,472
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

678
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,911
I don't like names like "pumpkin puss,"

679
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,998
but since you're upset,
we'll talk about that some other time.

680
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,838
- I'm only going as far as Westwood Village.
- Hey, beggars can't be choosers.

681
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,920
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

682
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,351
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

683
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,199
- Good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

684
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,795
- Have a good time in Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

685
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,074
- Take care.
- You too.

686
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,074
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

687
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:16,516
How can I help you, young lady?

688
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,030
Oh.

689
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,472
I'm here to pick up a first edition of Thomas
Hardy's <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

690
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:24,835
It's under Polanski.

691
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,195
- Yeah, you're talking books there, kid.
- Oh, I know.

692
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,793
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah. Oh, man.

693
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,313
- I just read it.
- Yeah.

694
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,789
I'm getting it as a gift for my husband.

695
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:38,070
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

696
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,072
Jim Stacy. This is my show. Welcome aboard.

697
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:44,152
We're real glad to have a pro like you
playing the heavy on the pilot.

698
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,480
And I gotta tell you, I came damn close
to being in <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

699
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:50,755
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

700
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,478
Let me tell you, I...

701
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,791
I just got my part by sheer luck.

702
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,396
Up until two weeks before
shooting, Fabian was in the part.

703
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,599
Then he breaks his shoulder doing a
<i>Virginian.</i> That's how I got it, so...

704
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,679
Ah.

705
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:08,914
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
something I heard about.

706
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,072
Was it true you almost got the McQueen part
in <i>The Great Escape?</i>

707
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:16,677
- Hilts, isn't it?
- Captain Hilts, actually.

708
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,592
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen.

709
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:22,753
Never had an audition. Never had a meeting.
Never met John Sturges.

710
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,434
So, no, I don't think you could say I...

711
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,556
I almost got the part, but...

712
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:29,916
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

713
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,398
- I suppose what's called in the American Army a hotshot pilot.
- Tsk.

714
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,599
But the story goes, for a brief moment,

715
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:42,753
McQueen almost passed on the movie,
and during that brief moment,

716
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,474
I, apparently, was on a list of four.

717
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:46,755
You have other plans?

718
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:51,996
I haven't seen Berlin yet from the ground or
from the air, and I plan on doing both before the war's over.

719
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,480
You and who?

720
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,831
- Me and... Me and three Georges.
- Which three Georges?

721
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,478
Peppard, Maharis and Chakiris.

722
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,074
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

723
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:01,480
That's gotta hurt.

724
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:03,630
Yeah, well, I didn't get it,

725
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,039
McQueen did it,

726
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,112
and, frankly, I never had a chance.

727
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,869
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

728
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,996
Captain Hilts.

729
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,117
Twenty days.

730
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,199
Right.

731
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,153
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

732
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,599
Cooler.

733
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,034
- One, please.
- Seventy-five cents.

734
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,434
What if I'm in the movie?

735
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,115
What do you mean?

736
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:30,873
I mean, I'm in the movie.

737
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,440
I'm Sharon Tate.

738
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,952
- You're in this?
- Mm-hm.

739
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:37,311
I play Miss Carlson, the Klutz.

740
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:39,675
That's me.

741
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,153
But that's the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

742
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,878
Well, that's me,
the girl from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

743
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,996
- Really?
- Really.

744
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,311
Hey, Rubin! Come out here.

745
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,838
This is the girl
from <i>Valley of the Dolls.</i>

746
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,150
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

747
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,231
- The girl from <i>Peyton Place?</i>
- No, the other one.

748
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,750
The one who ends up doing dirty movies.

749
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,269
Ohh.

750
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,474
- She's in this movie.
- Sharon Tate.

751
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,715
Well, welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.
Thank you for coming to our theater.

752
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,554
- Would you like to come in and see the show?
- Could I?

753
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,239
By all means.

754
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,239
Thank you.

755
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:32,039
- Hey, can I get a picture?
- Oh, sure.

756
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:33,119
Okay.

757
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,751
You know, why don't you stand over by the
poster so people will know who you are.

758
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,150
Okay. Could you?

759
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,313
Would you like some refreshments?

760
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,516
- Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

761
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,599
<i>- Can I ask you a personal question?</i>
<i>- I wish you would.</i>

762
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:44,798
<i>How did a nice boy like you get involved
with a group like the Heads?</i>

763
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,351
<i>I turned to them after I was rejected
by the Daughters of the American Revolution.</i>

764
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,438
<i>Very pleasant hotel here.</i>

765
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,198
<i>- Mr. Helm?
- Yes?</i>

766
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,515
<i>Oh!</i>

767
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,680
<i>I'm Freya.</i>

768
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,796
<i>Welcome to Denmark, Mr. Helm.</i>

769
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,997
<i>- These are for you. Street maps, places of interest.
- Hm.</i>

770
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:31,595
<i>- This is for you too.
- Hm.</i>

771
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,072
<i>- What year was that?
- 1949.</i>

772
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,436
<i>- Oh, that's a very good year.
- I'm here to help you in any way I can.</i>

773
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,319
<i>- That's very nice of you.
- Is there anything you'd like me to do?</i>

774
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,073
<i>- Yes, ma'am, a couple things.
- Yes, sir.</i>

775
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:46,631
<i>Would you mind getting off
my camera case, please?</i>

776
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,279
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right.</i>

777
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,476
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

778
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,630
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

779
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,639
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

780
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:06,238
<i>This is some kind of hotel you've got here.</i>

781
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,551
<i>Half a bottle is better than none.</i>

782
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,310
Morning, partner.

783
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,591
Probably come by to see you later.

784
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,993
That's far enough, jughead.

785
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,832
Name's not jughead.

786
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:06,315
What you doing around here, boy?

787
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,359
I'm thirsty. That's a saloon, ain't it?

788
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,591
Oh, yeah, that's a saloon.

789
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,239
- Only you can't come in.
- Mr. Gilbert.

790
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,192
Don't let me stop you
from earning your money.

791
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,158
I know how bored and restless you get
when you run out of tamales.

792
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,916
But, Mr. Gilbert, if I was you,

793
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:34,630
I'd find out that jughead's name.

794
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:38,670
Allow me to introduce the two of you.

795
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,631
This here is Bob Gilbert.

796
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:45,479
The Businessman?

797
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,788
That's right.

798
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:51,877
Business Bob Gilbert.
And who might he be, Caleb?

799
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,520
Well, that's a fella by the name of Madrid.

800
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,479
Johnny Madrid.

801
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:00,396
Who's Johnny Madrid?

802
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,279
He ain't from round here.

803
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,471
No, really.

804
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,595
Who is he, Caleb?

805
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,231
Oh, you're about to find out...

806
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,029
Businessman.

807
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,719
Ready when you are, Gilbert.

808
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,432
Johnny Madrid.

809
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:32,600
How long has it been?

810
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,195
Since that time in
Juárez, about three years ago.

811
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,673
Well, come on in and have a drink.

812
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,194
Hell, in that case...

813
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,555
buy you a drink, Caleb?

814
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,835
Sure, Johnny.

815
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:51,750
How about some mezcal?

816
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,957
Like that time in Juárez.

817
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:57,795
A lot of people died that day.

818
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,394
Yes, they did.

819
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,319
But we had a good time.

820
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:04,555
Didn't we?

821
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,711
Yeah, we did.

822
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,432
After you, DeCoteau.

823
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,832
Pepe! Get your behind behind that bar.

824
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,354
I have a guest.

825
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,149
How's the beans?

826
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,034
I've had worse.

827
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,795
One dollar.

828
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:46,518
To my wife and all my sweethearts.

829
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,073
May they never meet.

830
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,916
Señor Madrid, you care to join me at my table
where I entertain my guests?

831
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:03,475
I'd be delighted, Monsieur DeCoteau.

832
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,073
Take the bottle with you.

833
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,475
So, Johnny...

834
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:14,837
what brings you to Arroyo del Oro?

835
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,878
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

836
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:18,960
Money.

837
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,990
And who's paying around here?

838
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:24,149
I hope you.

839
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,760
Ah.

840
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,954
And what have you heard about me?

841
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:30,872
I heard about the Lancer Ranch.

842
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,155
All the cattle you've appropriated.

843
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:36,556
A lot of land, a lot of cows,
a lot of money, no law to speak of,

844
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,872
and nothing but an old man
and some Mexican ranch hands to shoo you off.

845
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,070
Say, where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours with the fiddle?

846
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,912
She's asleep.

847
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:55,159
Wake her the heck up, get her down here with her
fiddle and her bow, and entertain my guest.

848
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,869
But, please, don't hurt her this time.

849
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,958
I ain't gonna hurt her.

850
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,996
I just want her to play the fiddle.

851
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,271
Line? "Go... Go fetch her and tell her" what?

852
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,518
"Go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece..."

853
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,435
Right. Go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

854
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,636
she play her little chili
pepper heart out, right?

855
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:24,756
- Right.
- Got it.

856
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,238
I ain't gonna hurt her.

857
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:35,595
I just want her to play the fiddle.

858
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,797
Now, go fetch her and tell her
I'll give her a fat $5 gold piece,

859
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,952
she play her little chili pepper heart out.

860
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:43,039
Go on.

861
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:49,792
So, Johnny,

862
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,520
what else you heard? Hmm?

863
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:56,880
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

864
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,759
but Lancer's got money.

865
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,911
At some point,

866
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,355
he's gonna hire some guns

867
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:07,556
and push back.

868
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,671
- Line. Line. Line, line, line.
- "Maybe he already has."

869
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,840
Maybe...

870
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,456
- Goddamn it! I fucked this whole thing
up, Sam. - Keep going!

871
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,095
- I fucked this up.
- Fight through it.

872
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:28,237
Can we just go back? Please, can we just cut?

873
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,118
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, really, Sam, please.

874
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,216
- "Maybe he already has."
- All right, all right!

875
01:16:33,239 --> 01:16:35,356
- "Maybe he already has!"
- All right, goddamn it!

876
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:37,829
All right, all right! Whoo!

877
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:41,716
You're a goddamn outlaw, Rick. Come on, now.
Ahem. Whoo!

878
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:43,880
I got it. I got it.

879
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:46,514
Go back a bit, would you?

880
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,113
No, he's right. Back to one.

881
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:51,470
- Okay, now, use all that, baby.
- I'm gonna use it.

882
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,596
- Oh, I'm gonna use it.
- Put it all inside.

883
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,113
Mm-hm. I'm gonna use it.

884
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,119
And...

885
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,119
action.

886
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,710
I heard you're pushing Lancer pretty hard,

887
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,359
but Lancer's got money.

888
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:11,396
At some point,

889
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,832
he's gonna hire some guns and push back.

890
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:21,396
Maybe he already has.

891
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,199
Maybe.

892
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:29,118
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

893
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,398
Maybe I don't like his boots.

894
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,313
Maybe I don't like the way
he uses those boots to step on people.

895
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,153
What the fuck was that?!

896
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,675
Jesus Christ!

897
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,988
Fuck!

898
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,310
Piece of shit.

899
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,391
Fucking damn it, Rick, I swear to God.

900
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,077
Forgot your fucking lines, embarrassed yourself
like that in front of all those goddamn people!

901
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:03,230
Well, you were drinking all night, fucking drinking
again, eight goddamn fucking whiskey sours.

902
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,471
Fucking bullshit.

903
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:10,710
You're a fucking miserable drunk.

904
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,109
Not fucking remembering your fucking lines.

905
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:16,994
I practiced them, and now I don't
look like I goddamn practiced them!

906
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:19,355
You're sitting there like a fucking baboon!

907
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:23,078
Fuck! Eight fucking whiskey sours.

908
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:26,153
I couldn't stop at fucking three or four.
I have eight!

909
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,869
Why?! You're a fucking alcoholic.
You fucking drink too much, huh?

910
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,350
Every fucking night. Every fucking night.

911
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:34,556
That's it, that's fucking it!

912
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,597
That's fucking it.

913
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,909
You stop drinking right now, all right?

914
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,595
Make a promise to yourself.
You're gonna stop fucking drinking.

915
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,716
Oh, fuck it.

916
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,359
Damn it!

917
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:52,274
You show that little fucking girl.
You're gonna show that goddamn Jim Stacy.

918
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,552
You're gonna show all of them on that goddamn
fucking set who the fuck Rick Dalton is, all right?

919
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,791
Let me tell you something.

920
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,515
You don't get these lines right,

921
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,559
I'm gonna blow your
fucking brains out tonight.

922
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,112
All right? Your brains are gonna be
splattered all over your goddamn pool.

923
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,112
I mean it, motherfucker.

924
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,634
Get your shit together.

925
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,478
- Better? Okay.
- It's great.

926
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,510
Hey!

927
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,560
Hi.

928
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:58,119
Shit.

929
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,274
Fuck you, you fucking pig!

930
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:09,231
Oh, no.

931
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,796
Hello, hot stuff.

932
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,029
- Looks like third time's the charm.
- Mm.

933
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:30,275
How were those pickles?

934
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,591
Real good. They were the fancy kind.

935
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,234
- Mm.
- Mm.

936
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,840
Give me a lift?

937
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,395
Where are you going?

938
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,354
I'm going to Chatsworth.

939
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:47,199
Chatsworth?

940
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,992
You hitch up and down Burbank Boulevard all day
till someone says they'll drive you to Chatsworth?

941
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:55,639
Tourists love to drive me.

942
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,775
I'm their favorite part of their L.A.
vacation, you know?

943
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,430
They'll be telling stories
about the Hollywood hippie girl

944
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,195
that they gave a ride to the movie ranch
for the rest of their lives.

945
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:06,713
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

946
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,594
- Yeah.
- That's where you're going? Spahn Movie Ranch?

947
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,077
- Uh-huh.
- Why you going there?

948
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,880
I live there.

949
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,194
- Alone?
- No.

950
01:23:18,279 --> 01:23:19,475
Me and my friends.

951
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:25,273
So you and a bunch of friends like
you all live at Spahn Movie Ranch?

952
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,840
Yeah.

953
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,672
Well, hop in. I'll take you there.

954
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,520
Great!

955
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,351
- Go down here and get on the Hollywood Freeway.
- I know where it is.

956
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,997
Are you some old cowboy guy
that used to make movies there?

957
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:53,115
Whoa.

958
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,599
What?

959
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,559
I'm just surprised how accurate
that description of me really is.

960
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,350
Some old cowboy guy that used to shoot movies
at Spahn Ranch.

961
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,989
So you used to make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

962
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:16,275
Well, if by "the old-timey days,"
you mean television eight years ago, yeah.

963
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:17,713
Are you an actor?

964
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,439
No, I'm a stuntman.

965
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,750
You're a stuntman.

966
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,670
That's way better.

967
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,159
Why is that way better?

968
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,510
Actors are phony.

969
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,712
- Oh.
- Theyjust say lines that other people write

970
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:36,037
and pretend to murder people
on their stupid TV shows.

971
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,792
Meanwhile, real people are being murdered
every day in Vietnam.

972
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,359
Want me to suck your cock while driving?

973
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,235
How old are you?

974
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:16,515
What?

975
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,314
How old are you?

976
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,600
Wow, man.

977
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,270
That's the first time anybody
asked that in a long time.

978
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,909
What's the answer?

979
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:33,313
Okay. We gonna play kiddie games?

980
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:37,760
Eighteen. Feel better?

981
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,958
You got some ID, you know,
like a driver's license or something?

982
01:25:42,039 --> 01:25:43,314
Are you joking?

983
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:44,399
No, I'm not.

984
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:50,871
I need to see something official that verifies that
you're 18, which you don't have because you're not.

985
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:57,039
Talk about a bring-down bummer, dude.

986
01:25:57,119 --> 01:25:58,235
That's you.

987
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,319
Yeah.

988
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,436
Obviously, I'm not too young to fuck you.

989
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,431
But obviously, you are too old to fuck me.

990
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,957
What I'm too old to do is
go to jail for poontang.

991
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:20,113
Prison's been trying to get me all my life.
It ain't got me yet.

992
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:21,713
The day it does,

993
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,472
it won't be because of you.

994
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:25,555
No offense.

995
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:30,496
<i>You all right, honey?</i>

996
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,751
She's just fine, ain't you, shorty?

997
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,717
<i>I'm fine, Scott.</i>

998
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,615
<i>They haven't
hurt you?</i> MAN: Camera's ready, Mr. Dalton.

999
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,109
I'll be right out.

1000
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,840
<i>The war.</i>

1001
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:47,793
<i>I rode with the British cavalry in Indi...</i>

1002
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:42,157
Stand by, guys. We're going in five.

1003
01:27:57,479 --> 01:27:59,436
Lancer's boys are here!

1004
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:02,198
The old man here?

1005
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:03,475
Nada.

1006
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,479
But the son is.

1007
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,198
Ah. Heh-heh.

1008
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,159
The one from Boston.

1009
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:13,439
I don't know.

1010
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:15,713
You from Boston?

1011
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,869
Yes.

1012
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,474
It's the Boston one!

1013
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:22,112
Keep the others outside.

1014
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:24,673
Let the brother come in.

1015
01:28:26,199 --> 01:28:27,997
You heard him, Boston.

1016
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,878
Come on in, Boston. Heh.

1017
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:41,520
See, honey?

1018
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,909
I told you they'd come to parlay.

1019
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:46,715
You all right, honey?

1020
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,877
Oh, she's just fine.

1021
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,076
Ain't you, shorty?

1022
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,069
I'm fine, Scott.

1023
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,199
They haven't hurt you?

1024
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,917
Not yet, I ain't.

1025
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,832
But that can all change...

1026
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
like that.

1027
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,680
Say...

1028
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:09,953
where'd you get that limp?

1029
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:12,720
- From the war.
- Mm.

1030
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,036
Which side?

1031
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:18,953
I rode with the British cavalry in India.

1032
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,637
What'd they call that outfit?

1033
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:24,880
Bengal Lancers.

1034
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,837
Now, now, now, that is funny.

1035
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,389
- That is funny.
- That's not so funny.

1036
01:29:33,479 --> 01:29:34,800
Don't you get it?

1037
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,713
"Bengal Lancer"? Hm?

1038
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:39,720
Oh, yeah.

1039
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,472
I get it now.

1040
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,119
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1041
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,752
You do know kidnapping is a hanging offense.

1042
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,755
So is blowing the heads off little girls.

1043
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,314
But they can only hang me once, right?

1044
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,560
So...

1045
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,599
you come down here for a...

1046
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,989
For a Boston social?

1047
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:05,720
- Or we gonna talk price?
- How much?

1048
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:09,876
I'd say $50,000 would buy me

1049
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,430
a whole lot of chicken mole in Mexico.

1050
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,000
That's a lot of money.

1051
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:17,435
Well, she's a lot of little girl.

1052
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,840
Or don't you agree?

1053
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,880
I agree.

1054
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,914
So, what's next?

1055
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,390
I'll send one of my boys out to your ranch
to fill you in on all the details...

1056
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:35,079
but the one detail I'm gonna
fill you in on right now is this:

1057
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:41,070
I don't want no beaner bronco buster
handing me that $50,000.

1058
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:44,358
I want the old man himself.

1059
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:50,037
Murdoch Lancer puts $50,000 in my lap...

1060
01:30:50,119 --> 01:30:53,318
or I heave this little pitcher down a well!

1061
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:55,960
You got that, Boston?!

1062
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:57,470
Huh?

1063
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,920
Yeah.

1064
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,792
All right, messenger boy.

1065
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:04,832
Deliver my message.

1066
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,030
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet.

1067
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:16,952
Settle into it.

1068
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:18,359
Enjoy it.

1069
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,350
And cut!

1070
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,314
Oh, boy.

1071
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:26,868
I didn't hurt you there,
Marabella, with that throw, did I?

1072
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,469
No, no, no. I'm good. I got pads on.

1073
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:34,791
And I throw myself on the floor just for fun,
even when I'm not getting paid.

1074
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:36,319
The gate's clean.

1075
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,154
Rick, Rick, Rick.

1076
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:40,878
Put her there.

1077
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,109
- That was it.
- Really?

1078
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:43,475
That was absolutely fantastic.

1079
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,875
- Oh, thank you.
- I loved it.

1080
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,000
Hey, and your idea about throwing the little girl
on the ground, that just worked like a charm.

1081
01:31:49,079 --> 01:31:52,356
- I figured you said Shakespeare, so... Yeah.
- That's right. That was...

1082
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:54,556
That's what I mean by "scare me."

1083
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,029
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Evil Hamlet scares people.

1084
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:59,588
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way...

1085
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,796
- "Beaner bronco buster"?
- Yeah.

1086
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,475
- Where the hell did that come from?
- I don't know. Improv.

1087
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:09,270
That was wonderful. It was just...
That was a triple alliterative improv.

1088
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:10,918
You don't hear those too often.

1089
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,775
- Okay? We're all good.
- All right. We don't...?

1090
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,359
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done. That was fantastic.

1091
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:18,034
- All right.
- Okay, moving on. We're in the bordello.

1092
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:19,119
Next setup!

1093
01:32:23,319 --> 01:32:27,154
That was the best acting I've
ever seen in my whole life.

1094
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,560
Thank you.

1095
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,757
Rick fucking Dalton.

1096
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,716
That's a car.

1097
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,759
That's a strange car.

1098
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:09,712
Snake, go see who's outside.

1099
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,319
So who is it?

1100
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:25,675
I ain't for sure yet.

1101
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:28,271
It's a bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1102
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:30,475
Keep an eye on him.

1103
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,680
Come on.

1104
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,597
Where the hell is everybody?

1105
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,956
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1106
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:52,153
She's down by the chop shop.

1107
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,110
- Hey!
- Hello!

1108
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,271
Gypsy! I want you to come meet my new friend.

1109
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:08,479
Some old-looking dude in a Hawaiian
shirt who just gave Pussycat a ride home.

1110
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,194
He just gave her a lift?

1111
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,632
Nope. She's bringing him
down the ranch to meet everybody.

1112
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,279
Stay by the door.
Tell me if he starts coming this way.

1113
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,635
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1114
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,076
And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.

1115
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:25,479
Think nothing of it.

1116
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,391
We love Pussy.

1117
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:28,708
Yes, we do.

1118
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,837
Hey, where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1119
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,515
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1120
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,158
Really?

1121
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:37,277
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1122
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:40,431
Well, not everybody-everybody,
but mostly everybody.

1123
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:44,319
Drag.

1124
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,313
I really wanted Cliff to meet Charlie.

1125
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,711
I think Charlie's really gonna dig you.

1126
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,109
- Angel, hold up.
- Well, maybe next time.

1127
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:54,640
Yeah, you got to come back.

1128
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,115
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

1129
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:02,279
So how's it all comparing to your glory days?

1130
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:04,356
Well, things have changed.

1131
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,716
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1132
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,917
I used to ride horses every
day back in Tennessee.

1133
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,275
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1134
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:16,317
Well, every week.

1135
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:18,038
All right.

1136
01:36:18,119 --> 01:36:19,838
Ain't she just darling?

1137
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:26,637
So my name is Lulu.

1138
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,948
This is Tex.

1139
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:33,430
We're gonna be leading you on a great trail ride
through the beautiful Santa Susana canyons.

1140
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,796
Now, Curt, I hear you're
already an experienced rider.

1141
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,189
- Yes.
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?

1142
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:40,634
- Yes, I am.
- Hey, Tex?

1143
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,952
- Come here.
- So if you're both experienced riders,

1144
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:47,271
I guess we'll just make
this ride about having fun.

1145
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:48,510
You ready to have some fun?

1146
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,512
So Pussycat brought back some guy with her.

1147
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,119
- Gypsy wants you to go give him a look-see.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1148
01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:17,113
Oh, and here's someone you
absolutely have to meet.

1149
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,590
One of our most favorite sons.

1150
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:22,319
Tex, come on over here and say hi to Cliff.

1151
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:24,591
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1152
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,310
- What part of Texas you from?
- Oh, a place you never heard of.

1153
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:29,318
Copeville.

1154
01:37:29,319 --> 01:37:31,551
Ah. Ever been to Houston?

1155
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,119
Course I have.

1156
01:37:33,239 --> 01:37:35,708
Yeah, I spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang.

1157
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,154
In August, no less.

1158
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,556
That doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.

1159
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:43,118
It's the last cop's jaw I ever
broke, I can tell you that.

1160
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:48,479
Man...

1161
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,319
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1162
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:54,590
The Hawaiian guy seems to be okay.

1163
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,791
Everybody's talking all friendly.

1164
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,072
- Enjoy your day!
- Thank you.

1165
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:02,520
Tex checked him out,
and now he's riding away.

1166
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,435
If he comes this way, let me know.

1167
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,800
Hey, does George Spahn still own this ranch?

1168
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,872
Yeah, George still owns it.

1169
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,994
- Does he still live here?
- Yeah.

1170
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:18,993
Does he still live right there?

1171
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,119
Yeah.

1172
01:38:20,199 --> 01:38:21,520
Is he here now?

1173
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:23,274
I guess so.

1174
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,920
So George gave you all permission to be here?

1175
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:30,189
Course he did.

1176
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:31,918
And y'all take care of him?

1177
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,235
Oh, we take care of George.

1178
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:36,515
We love George.

1179
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,595
Is there anything wrong
with me saying hello to an old friend?

1180
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,511
You can't see him right now.

1181
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,876
Why can't I see him right now?

1182
01:38:48,439 --> 01:38:49,668
Because he's napping.

1183
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,199
This is his nap time.

1184
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:06,073
Well, I think I'll just go see for myself.

1185
01:39:07,319 --> 01:39:09,198
You never know.

1186
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:10,918
He might have just woke up.

1187
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,671
The old Hawaiian guy's coming this way.

1188
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,552
Okay, y'all, beat it.

1189
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,868
I'll handle this guy.

1190
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:32,239
Fine.

1191
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,279
You the mama bear?

1192
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,195
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

1193
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:26,238
I'm an old friend of George's.
Thought I'd stop and say hello.

1194
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,671
That's very nice of you,
but unfortunately, you picked the wrong time.

1195
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,432
George is taking a nap right now.

1196
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,832
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1197
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,239
Yes, it is.

1198
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,988
- What's your name?
- Cliff Booth.

1199
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:40,479
How do you know George?

1200
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,994
I used to shoot Westerns here at the ranch.

1201
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:45,037
When was the last time you saw George?

1202
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,716
Oh, I'd say about...

1203
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,000
eight years ago.

1204
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:53,475
Oh.

1205
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,359
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.

1206
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,836
When he wakes up,
I'll let him know you came by.

1207
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,394
I'd really like to say a quick
hello now while I'm here.

1208
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:05,993
Came a long ways.

1209
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:08,873
Don't know when I'll get back this way again.

1210
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:11,755
Oh, I understand,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1211
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,233
Impossible?

1212
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:16,118
Why is that impossible?

1213
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:19,556
Because me and George like to watch TV
on Sunday night... <i>F.B.I.</i> and <i>Bonanza.</i>

1214
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,456
...but George finds it hard to keep awake
that late, so I make him take a nap now

1215
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:24,551
so I don't get gypped
out of my George TV time.

1216
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,829
Ah.

1217
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:31,319
Well, look, Red, I'm coming in there.

1218
01:41:31,399 --> 01:41:34,949
With my own two eyes,
I'm gonna get a good look at George.

1219
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,479
And this...

1220
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:40,675
ain't stopping me.

1221
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,479
Okay.

1222
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,193
Suit yourself.

1223
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:15,475
He back there?

1224
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:19,078
Door at the end of the hallway.

1225
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,911
You might have to shake him awake.
I fucked his brains out this morning.

1226
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:30,520
He may be tired.

1227
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,472
Oh, Mr. Eight Years Ago?

1228
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:49,676
George is blind, so you'll probably
have to tell him who you are.

1229
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,354
George, you awake?

1230
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,716
George?

1231
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:40,076
George?

1232
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:45,079
George?

1233
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:50,279
- George!
- Jesus.

1234
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:52,351
- Hi, George.
- Wait a minute.

1235
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:55,150
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1236
01:44:55,239 --> 01:44:58,358
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Who are you?

1237
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,314
It's Cliff Booth.

1238
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:05,032
- Just stopped in to say hello and see how you're doing.
- John Wilkes Booth?

1239
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:06,679
No, Cliff Booth.

1240
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,239
Who's that?

1241
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:12,880
I used to shoot <i>Bounty Law</i> here, George.

1242
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,952
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1243
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:17,873
- Who?
- Rick Dalton.

1244
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:19,552
The Dalton Brothers?

1245
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,359
No, Rick Dalton.

1246
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,909
Who's that?

1247
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,912
He was the star of <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1248
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,672
And who are you?

1249
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,472
I was Rick's stunt double.

1250
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,511
- Rick who?
- Uh...

1251
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,319
It don't matter, George.

1252
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,515
We were colleagues from the past, and I
just wanted to make sure you're doing okay.

1253
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,909
- I'm not doing okay.
- What's the matter?

1254
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,595
Can't see shit.
Would you call that "the matter"?

1255
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:50,958
- The man can't see shit, okay?
- I know. I'm sorry about that. I was told.

1256
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:53,110
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1257
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,036
Would that be the little redhead out front?

1258
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:01,600
What the fuck is the matter with you?

1259
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:05,560
First you wake me up, and now you're
pretending that I didn't tell you

1260
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,359
I was fucking blind!

1261
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,912
How am I gonna know what
the hell color the head

1262
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,753
of the girl is that's with me all the time?

1263
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,717
Oh, fair enough, George.

1264
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:22,476
- No. Jesus Christ.
- Come on, George. All right.

1265
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,119
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1266
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,557
I don't know who you are...

1267
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,791
but you touched me today.

1268
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,319
You came to visit me.

1269
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:45,470
Now I got to go back to sleep.

1270
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,673
I got to watch <i>F.B.I</i>. tonight.

1271
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,439
I watch it with Squeaky.

1272
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,474
She gets all pissed off if I fall asleep.

1273
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,239
What happens when she gets pissed
off, George?

1274
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:02,630
Nothing.

1275
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:06,590
I just don't like to disappoint her.

1276
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:14,671
So you gave all these hippies
permission to be here?

1277
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,149
Just who the fuck are you?

1278
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:25,152
I'm Cliff Booth.

1279
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:28,756
I'm a stuntman.
We used to work together, George.

1280
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,594
And I just want to make sure you're okay.

1281
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,390
And that all these hippies
aren't taking advantage of you.

1282
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:38,279
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1283
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:40,238
She loves me.

1284
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,512
So suck on that.

1285
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:55,113
You take care, George.

1286
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,639
Goddamn it.

1287
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:26,434
You embarrassed me.

1288
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,238
Yeah, sorry about that.

1289
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:35,118
How'd your little talk with George go?
Are we kidnapping him?

1290
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,192
Not the word I'd use.

1291
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:39,496
Now that you've talked to him,
do you believe everything's all right?

1292
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,398
Not exactly.

1293
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:44,791
- This was a mistake. You should leave.
- Way ahead of you.

1294
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:51,716
George isn't blind!

1295
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,279
You're the blind one!

1296
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:39,793
You do that?

1297
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:46,113
You know, that's not my car.

1298
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,070
That's my boss's car.

1299
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:52,829
And if something were to happen to my
boss's car, well, I'd get in trouble.

1300
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,751
Lucky for you, he's got a spare.

1301
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,840
Fix it.

1302
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,155
Ha-ha-ha! Fuck you.

1303
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,560
Ugh!

1304
01:50:47,319 --> 01:50:48,355
Ladies.

1305
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,757
Come one step closer and I
will knock his teeth out.

1306
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:11,195
Fix it.

1307
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,155
Can I at least get a rag
to wipe my face first?

1308
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,798
Nope.

1309
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,599
Tire first.

1310
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,597
- Sundance.
- Yeah.

1311
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:33,229
Get on a horse,
go get Tex and get his ass down here.

1312
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:34,319
Okay.

1313
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,273
<i>I love you.</i>

1314
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,431
Tex! Tex!

1315
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:14,908
That Hawaiian guy's back at the ranch
kicking Clem's face in.

1316
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:16,520
Ahh, shit!

1317
01:52:17,319 --> 01:52:18,720
I'll take over for Tex.

1318
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,949
Right this way.

1319
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,759
Hyah! Hyah!

1320
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,800
Clem, you all right?

1321
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,313
How do?

1322
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:38,551
What a day. Shit, I almost lost my shit.

1323
01:54:26,279 --> 01:54:27,600
You, uh...

1324
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,350
You want to come in and watch my <i>F.B.I.?</i>

1325
01:54:30,439 --> 01:54:33,034
Why, I just figured we would.
I got a six-pack in the back.

1326
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,520
Thought we'd order a pizza.

1327
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,989
All right.

1328
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:00,954
<i>Eighteen miles to Pendleton, Willard.</i>

1329

1330

<i>and back at El Toro
before my kids go to bed.</i>

1331
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,469
Hey, bought me an
acid-dipped cigarette today.

1332
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,835
Oh, yeah?

1333
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,912
You want to buy a cigarette dipped in acid?

1334
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,752
Yeah.

1335
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,435
If I'm gonna trip, I want to trip here, man.
Walk in the woods. Not in my home.

1336
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,229
Just gonna stash it here.

1337
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:29,515
- Don't smoke it by mistake.
- Yeah.

1338
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,034
You want to smoke some, smoke some.
Just save me some.

1339
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,837
Nah, I don't need to trip out on no acid.

1340
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,797
My booze don't need no buddy.

1341
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,157
- Wha... Oh! Here I come. Here I come.
- Oh! Oh.

1342
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:44,359
Mm.

<i>What's the trouble, corporal?</i>

1344

a hurry to get someplace.</i>

01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,432
<i>Oh, fine.</i>

1347
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,957
<i>- Well, take it as fast as you can.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1348
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:05,600
That PCH?

1349
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,717
Yeah, yeah. Malibu.

1350
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,189
Puerco Canyon or some shit. I don't know.

1351
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,680
Uh-oh! Here comes trouble.

1352
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,154
Boom! Ha-ha!

1353
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:26,277
Oh, man. Right in the face.

1354
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:39,719
That was a smooth leap.

1355
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,800
Thank you.

1356
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,319
Dead number two.

1357
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:55,398
I like that shot.

1358
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:57,516
That guy's a fucking prick.

1359
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:06,311
That's Bobby Hogan. Good guy.

1360

<i>existing quite nicely within Sergio
Corbucci's rogues gallery of antiheroes.</i>

1397
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:24,431
<i>In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi
and the fuss they made over him</i>

1398
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,229
<i>and his</i> Nebraska Jim <i>costar Daphna Ben-Cobo.</i>

1399
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:31,438
All right there, paparazzos.
All right. Take it easy.

1400
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:36,751
<i>He loved the food so much that
during his stay, Rick gained almost 15 pounds.</i>

1401
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,832
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

1402
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:43,277
<i>He thought the post-synced,
"every actor speaks their own language,"</i>

1403
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,239
<i>Tower of Babel shooting style
of European movies was ridiculous.</i>

1404
01:59:48,279 --> 01:59:52,159
<i>While in Rome, Marvin plugged Rick
into three other Italian productions.</i>

1405
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,076
<i>His second Western was</i>
Kill Me Quick, Ringo, Said the Gringo,

1406
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:59,869
<i>also starring Joseph Cotten
and directed by Calvin Jackson Padget,</i>

<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

1408
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:04,795
<i>His third was an Italian/Spanish coproduction</i>

1409
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:09,033
<i>that paired him with Telly Savalas,
titled</i> Red Blood, Red Skin,

1410
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:13,273
<i>directed by Joaquín Romero Marchent
and based on the Floyd Raye Wilson novel,</i>

1411
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:16,033
The Only Good Indian Is a Dead Indian.

1412
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:23,479
<i>And his fourth, a Spaghetti secret agent, James Bond
rip-off-type flick called</i> Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!,

1413
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,198
<i>directed by Antonio Margheriti.</i>

1414
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:11,435
<i>Ultimately making Rick's
six-month Italian sojourn fairly profitable,</i>

1415
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,434
<i>although his swank Roman apartment ate up
a big chunk of his earnings.</i>

1416
02:01:17,359 --> 02:01:20,478
<i>So as Rick returns to Hollywood via Pan Am,</i>

1417
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:24,030
<i>he has four new movies under his belt,
some money in his pocket,</i>

1418
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:29,194
<i>and his brand-spanking-new Italian wife,
starlet Francesca Cappucci.</i>

1419
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,913
<i>Hurtling through the air towards a new life
and uncertain future,</i>

1420
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,198
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

1421
02:01:42,359 --> 02:01:46,239
<i>Way back in coach,
working on his bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

1422
02:01:46,359 --> 02:01:49,353
<i>Cliff Booth returned to Los Angeles as well.</i>

1423
02:01:50,039 --> 02:01:54,556
<i>He kept Rick company
during his entire six-month stay in Italy.</i>

1424
02:01:55,359 --> 02:01:59,672
<i>However, as the two men return home,
they've come to an understanding.</i>

1425
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,159
Well, here it goes now.

1426
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:03,640
With the, uh...

1427
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:06,600
With the new wife, I...

1428
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,798
I just... I can't afford you anymore, Cliff.

1429
02:02:11,239 --> 02:02:14,676
You know? I can barely
afford my own house anymore.

1430
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,434
So I think the plan is to sell the house

1431
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,354
and buy a condo in Toluca
Lake, bank the money.

1432
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:23,556
You know, live off it. That type of thing.

1433
02:02:24,199 --> 02:02:27,113
Hopefully, I score come next pilot season.

1434
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:28,429
That's a good plan.

1435
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,555
Yeah.

1436
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:30,640
You know,

1437
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:33,069
by then, I'll know if I have a career or not,

1438
02:02:33,159 --> 02:02:37,119
if I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says,

1439
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:41,239
or if I'm one step closer
to going back to Missouri.

1440
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:44,877
So when this whole European journey is over,

1441
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,194
I think we've...

1442
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:50,314
We've reached the end of the trail, Cliff.

1443
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:04,989
<i>So these last four Italian flicks,
after nine years together,</i>

1444
02:03:05,079 --> 02:03:08,198
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's final rodeo.</i>

1445
02:03:08,279 --> 02:03:11,033
<i>Cliff doesn't have a clue what he's gonna do.</i>

1446
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:13,315
<i>The only thing the two men know of for sure:</i>

1447
02:03:13,399 --> 02:03:16,996
<i>Tonight, Rick and Cliff will
have a good old-fashioned drunk.</i>

1448
02:03:17,079 --> 02:03:20,278
<i>Both men know,
once the plane touches down in El Segundo,</i>

1449
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:22,750
<i>it'll be the end of an era for both of them.</i>

1450
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,908
<i>And when you come to the end of the line with a buddy who
is more than a brother and a little less than a wife,</i>

1451
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,153
<i>getting blind drunk together is really
the only way to say farewell.</i>

1452
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:29,956
Here it is, honey.

1453
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,239
- You like it?
- I love it.

1454
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,074

And this is the nursery.

1463

- Oh, my God, Sharon. It's perfect.
- Do you love it?

1464
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,229
Little shoes!

1465
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:16,635
I know.

1466
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,234
I'm about to burst.

1467
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:22,630
- I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother.
- Thank you.

1468
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:40,953
- Thanks, Gillian.
- Bye!

1469

02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,277
<i>Around midnight,
a completely drunk Rick Dalton started making</i>

1542
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:20,670
<i>a blender of frozen margaritas.</i>

1543
02:11:23,399 --> 02:11:24,399
All right.

1544
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:27,229
We're walking.

1545
02:11:27,399 --> 02:11:31,552
<i>At the same time, Cliff was attaching
a leash to an excited Brandy's dog collar.</i>

1546
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:32,640
I know.

1547
02:11:38,199 --> 02:11:39,872
I remember you.

1548
02:11:40,359 --> 02:11:44,069
- A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do?
- You smoke it. It gets you high.

1549
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:46,230
- How much?
- Fifty cents.

1550
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:49,270
Fifty cents.

1551
02:11:49,359 --> 02:11:51,511
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

1552
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:56,554
Tonight the night?

1553
02:11:58,039 --> 02:11:59,155
Why not?

1554
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:25,189
And away we go.

1555
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:31,512
Our Polish friend said it was
the hottest day of the year.

1556
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:35,395
Despite the fact that he said
it, actually, it might be true.

1557
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:57,636
Goddamn.

1558
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,792
Fucking private road.

1559
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,395
Damn property taxes up the butt.

1560
02:14:03,479 --> 02:14:04,800
Goddamn.

1561
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:15,716
Bunch of goddamn fucking hippies.

1562
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,189
What the fuck?

1563
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:22,475
Hey, you!

1564
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:27,118
Yeah, asshole, I'm talking to you!

1565
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:31,238
What the hell do you think you're doing
bringing that noisy hunk of shit

1566
02:14:31,319 --> 02:14:33,390
around here at midnight?

1567
02:14:33,479 --> 02:14:36,199
This is a private road, all right?

1568
02:14:36,279 --> 02:14:38,875
Who are you? And who are you here to see?

1569
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:41,634
Nobody, sir. We just got lost
and a little turned around.

1570
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:43,353
Ah, horseshit.

1571
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:49,594
You fucking hippies came up here
to smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

1572
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,319
Next time you want to try
that, fix your fucking muffler.

1573
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,519
- Look, we're really sorry we disturbed you.
- Look, chief, you don't belong here.

1574
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:01,550
Now, take this mechanical asshole
and get it off my fucking street!

1575
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,920
Hey!

1576
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:18,274
Dennis Hopper!
Move this fucking piece of shit!

1577
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:20,795
All right. Just give me a
moment to turn it around.

1578
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,632
Drive it backwards, numbnuts,

1579
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:26,390
- but fucking drive it, and drive it now!
- Okay. Okay. Stop yelling.

1580
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:28,073
Hold your horses. We're leaving.

1581
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,630
The hell are you looking at,
you little ginger-haired fucker?

1582
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:38,474
Hey, you come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

1583
02:15:45,319 --> 02:15:46,800
Dirty fucking hippies.

1584
02:16:00,439 --> 02:16:02,895
There in his fancy fucking
house, thinking he's handled it.

1585
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:05,957
But he's seen us. He's awake. He's alert.

1586
02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:10,916
They're all awake. They're listening to
fucking records. Everybody's fucking awake!

1587
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,149
Look!

1588
02:16:12,239 --> 02:16:14,310
What did Charlie say?

1589
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:18,510
"Go to Terry's old house and
kill everybody in there."

1590
02:16:19,039 --> 02:16:22,750
And you heard him yourself.
He said, "Make it witchy."

1591
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:25,877
Now, he either said that,

1592
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,792
or I'm a liar.

1593
02:16:29,039 --> 02:16:32,316
Now, are any one of you calling me a liar?

1594
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,360
Hmm?

1595
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:36,440
How about you?

1596
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,513
Are you calling me a liar?

1597
02:16:39,959 --> 02:16:42,076
No, of course not.

1598
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:43,118
Good.

1599
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,520
Hold it.

1600
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:47,114
- Was that Rick Dalton?
- Who?

1601
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:48,429
The guy from <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1602
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,272
- Who, Jake Cahill?
- Yeah.

1603
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,795
That guy in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1604
02:16:53,399 --> 02:16:56,597
Wait a minute. That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at me?

1605
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,156
He was older, but, yeah, I think so.

1606
02:16:59,239 --> 02:17:02,311
- So who's this Rick guy?
- Jesus Christ, Sadie, get it together.

1607
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:05,711
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill on a
cowboy show in the '50s called <i>Bounty Law.</i>

1608
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:07,639
Fuck you, Katie.

1609
02:17:07,719 --> 02:17:10,996
Sorry I don't know the name
of every fascist on TV in the '50s.

1610
02:17:11,079 --> 02:17:15,596
I can't believe that asshole
in the robe was Jake Cahill.

1611
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:18,478
When I was a kid,
I had a <i>Bounty Law</i> lunch box.

1612
02:17:18,559 --> 02:17:21,200
That was my favorite of all my lunch boxes.

1613
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,953
Dig this!

1614
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,796
When we've been having our trip sessions, I've
been expanding on this one idea in my head.

1615
02:17:29,879 --> 02:17:33,430
All right, dig it. We all grew up
watching TV, you know what I mean?

1616
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:38,316
And if you grew up watching TV,
that means you grew up watching murder.

1617
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:39,549
Mm-hm.

1618
02:17:39,639 --> 02:17:44,156
Every show on TV
that wasn't <i>I Love Lucy</i> was about murder.

1619
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:47,358
So my idea is...

1620
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:49,829
we kill the people who taught us to kill.

1621
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,993
I mean, where the fuck are we, man?
We are in fucking Hollywood, man.

1622
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:59,716
The people an entire generation grew up
watching kill people live here.

1623
02:17:59,799 --> 02:18:03,316
And they live in pig-shit fucking luxury.
I say fuck them.

1624
02:18:03,399 --> 02:18:05,399
I say we cut their cocks
off and make them eat it.

1625
02:18:06,319 --> 02:18:08,356
That's a great idea, Sadie.

1626
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:12,477
You two ready to kill some piggies?

1627
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:24,150
Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

1628
02:18:24,239 --> 02:18:28,597
Sorry, I forgot my knife in the car.
Can I go...? Can I go back and get it?

1629
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,000
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1630
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:32,149
Go on. Wait a minute.

1631
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:35,352
- What?
- I locked the car. You'll need keys to get in.

1632
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,600
Oh...

1633
02:18:39,639 --> 02:18:41,518
Right. Thank you.

1634
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:44,273
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1635
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:47,397
- Just hurry up.
- Yeah, just a little minute.

1636
02:18:57,559 --> 02:18:59,313
Oh, that fucking bitch!

1637
02:18:59,399 --> 02:19:02,234
Calm down.
There's a fucking house right there.

1638
02:19:03,639 --> 02:19:06,200
- What do we do now?
- We do what we came to do.

1639
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,431
And when we're done,
we split up and hitch home.

1640
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,351
Any more questions? Hmm?

1641
02:19:13,719 --> 02:19:16,554
Okay, pig killers, let's kill some piggies.

1642
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:18,040
All right.

1643
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:32,279
Oh, someone's hungry.

1644
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,120
All right.

1645
02:19:44,159 --> 02:19:45,799
It's feeding time.

1646
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,235
Brandy, couch.

1647
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:58,319
And don't you mo...

1648
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,680
Oh, man.

1649
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,920
Ahh...

1650
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:19,877
The train has left the station.

1651
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:28,040
Bad idea.

1652
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:30,113
Whoa.

1653
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:20,638
You go around there,
see if there's a back entrance.

1654
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:21,954
All right? Go.

1655
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,953
Hey.

1656
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,994
I am doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

1657
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:20,310
Now, I do not want to get into it tonight.

1658
02:23:29,799 --> 02:23:32,554
Uh... Can I help you?

1659
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:39,950
Shit.

1660
02:23:41,239 --> 02:23:43,118
How many other people are here?

1661
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,033
Oh, just the one sleeping in the back there.

1662
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,751
Go get him and bring him
into the living room.

1663
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:53,194
- What if he says no?
- Don't take no for an answer.

1664
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,476
You're the one with the knife.
Get him in here!

1665
02:23:58,159 --> 02:23:59,159
Hey.

1666
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:06,917
You are real, right?

1667
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,674
I'm as real as a doughnut, motherfucker.

1668
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:20,636
What the fuck?

1669
02:24:25,079 --> 02:24:27,150
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

1670
02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:31,216
Go to the living room. FRANCESCA
What is going on, huh?

1671
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:37,837
- Go!
<i>- Si, si.</i>

1672
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:41,513
Who the fuck's that?

1673
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,600
I don't know.

1674
02:24:43,879 --> 02:24:44,950
Francesca.

1675
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:54,356
Oh. Uh...

1676
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:55,440
What...?

1677
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:58,073
Oh, I know you.

1678
02:24:58,159 --> 02:24:59,992
I know all three of you.

1679
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,156
Yeah. Spahn Ranch.

1680
02:25:03,879 --> 02:25:06,554
Spahn Ranch. Yeah. Whoo!

1681
02:25:08,079 --> 02:25:11,516
I don't know your name,
but I remember that hair.

1682
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:15,670
And you, I remember your white little face.

1683
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,717
And you were on a horsie.

1684
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,200
Yeah.

1685
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:22,231
Uh... You are...?

1686
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:24,757
I'm the devil,

1687
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:27,674
and I'm here to do the devil's business.

1688
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:34,556
Nah, it was dumber than that.
Something like... Rex.

1689
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:37,314
- God, shoot him, Tex!
- Tex.

1690
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:41,309
Fuck!

1691
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:57,873
Son of a bitch!

1692
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:37,360
Hey, you.

1693
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,396
How dare you come into my
house, motherfucker!

1694
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:10,237
Wow, man.

1695
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:43,120
Ugh.

1696
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:04,430
What the fuck?!

1697
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:07,558
Jesus Christ.

1698
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:25,713
Holy shit.

1699
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:31,593
Francesca! Francesca, honey!

1700
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:53,775
<i>- 10,000 block, Cielo Drive.</i>
- Sir, around what time was it

1701
02:29:53,799 --> 02:29:55,836
when you confronted the intruder?

1702
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:58,070
It was about midnight.

1703
02:29:58,159 --> 02:29:59,229
- Around midnight?
- Yeah.

1704
02:29:59,319 --> 02:30:00,834
How do you know it was midnight?

1705
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:03,833
Well, I was in the kitchen.

1706
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:06,915
You know, I was making margaritas, and...

1707
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,355
I heard the sound of a noisy muffler.
I looked up at the clock.

1708
02:30:11,479 --> 02:30:13,630
It said... The kitchen clock said midnight.

1709
02:30:13,719 --> 02:30:17,430
- Twelve o'clock exactly?
- I mean, it could have been 12:05.

1710
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:19,671
- Something like that.
- And you didn't see them again

1711
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,115
until the woman attacked you in the pool.

1712
02:30:22,239 --> 02:30:23,639
No, no.

1713
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:26,351
So, what did these perpetrators do?

1714
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:29,079
Perpetrators? They were hippie assholes.

1715
02:30:29,159 --> 02:30:32,630
Two of them burst through
the front door there,

1716
02:30:32,719 --> 02:30:37,077
and the guy hippie said he was the devil.

1717
02:30:37,159 --> 02:30:39,914
And he said, "I'm here to...

1718
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,150
do some devil shit."

1719
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:44,879
Or... That's not verbatim, but...

1720
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:47,793
- "Some devil shit"?
- Yeah, "devil shit."

1721
02:31:01,879 --> 02:31:03,996
And away we go.

1722
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,271
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1723
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:12,272
What hospital you going to, Cliff?
I'll meet you there, huh?

1724
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:14,875
You don't want to meet me in no hospital.

1725
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,753
Why don't you go take care of your lady.

1726
02:31:16,879 --> 02:31:19,872
Hey, she just took five
fucking sleeping pills.

1727
02:31:19,959 --> 02:31:21,916
She'll be asleep till Columbus Day.

1728
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:25,431
These guys will probably have to come
out here again just to wake her ass up.

1729
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:28,718
Hey, I'm not gonna die.
I may get a limp, but I ain't gonna die.

1730
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:30,756
- It's not my time yet, man.
- All right.

1731
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:36,477
So no use waiting in some waiting room. Why
don't you go lie naked with that fine creature.

1732
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:38,074
Come visit me tomorrow.

1733
02:31:38,159 --> 02:31:39,559
Bring bagels.

1734
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:42,957
You want to do something for
me, check on Brandy.

1735
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:46,032
She may be a little shook up after that.
She may want to sleep with you.

1736
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:49,352
Are you kidding me?
She's sleeping with Francesca right now.

1737
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:51,511
You might never get her back. Heh-heh.

1738
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:53,272
- We got to go.
- All right, then, Cliff.

1739
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:55,750
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

1740
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:00,838
Hey. Hey.

1741
02:32:04,639 --> 02:32:06,438
You're a good friend, Cliff.

1742
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,114
I try.

1743
02:32:41,479 --> 02:32:42,479
Hello?

1744
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:45,358
Hey.

1745
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:48,158
I'm Jay Sebring.
I'm a friend of the Polanskis.

1746
02:32:48,719 --> 02:32:51,280
You're Rick Dalton, right?

1747
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:54,238
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Rick Dalton.

1748
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,871
- Live next door.
- Oh, I know.

1749
02:32:56,959 --> 02:32:59,713
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

1750
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:03,255
If she ever wants to put a bounty on Roman's
head, she just has to go next door, right?

1751
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,510
No shit.

1752
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:09,510
What the fuck happened?

1753
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:12,194
Oh, these fucking hippie weirdos,

1754
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:14,556
they broke into my house.

1755
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:17,317
What do you mean, like, trying to rob you?

1756
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:19,198
We don't know what the fuck they wanted.

1757
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:23,319
Were they robbing me? I don't know.
Were they freaking out on some bummer trip?

1758
02:33:23,399 --> 02:33:26,710
Who knows? But they tried to
kill my wife and my buddy.

1759
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:30,230
- Jesus Christ. Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1760
02:33:30,319 --> 02:33:34,030
Now, my buddy and his dog killed two of them,
and then, uh...

1761
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:37,157
Well, shit. I torched the last one.

1762
02:33:37,239 --> 02:33:38,239
"Torched"?

1763
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:41,596
Yeah. I burnt her ass to a crisp.

1764
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:44,593
- How'd you do that?
- Well, believe it or not, I...

1765
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:48,754
- I got a flamethrower in my toolshed.
- Oh, from <i>The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.</i>

1766
02:33:49,639 --> 02:33:51,438
Yeah!

1767
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1768
02:33:53,079 --> 02:33:54,673
That's the one.

1769
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:57,194
Yeah, it still works too. Thank God.

1770
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:59,474
Is everybody okay?

1771
02:33:59,559 --> 02:34:03,951
Well, the fucking hippies
aren't, that's for goddamn sure.

1772
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:05,599
Yeah. But I'm fine.

1773
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,433
You know, my wife's fine.

1774
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:11,912
- We're just a little shook up, is all.
- Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

1775
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:13,875
Yeah.

1776
02:34:13,959 --> 02:34:16,713
<i>Jay, honey, is everything all right?</i>

1777
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:18,472
Everything's okay now, honey.

1778
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:21,672
Uh, but some hippies broke
into the house next door.

1779
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,592
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1780
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,672
<i>Oh, that's terrifying.</i>

1781
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:27,318
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

1782
02:34:27,399 --> 02:34:31,314
I'm talking to your next-door
neighbor about it right now.

1783
02:34:31,399 --> 02:34:32,879
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

1784
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:36,391
Yeah, that's me.

1785
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,510
<i>Oh! Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

1786
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:42,317
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

1787
02:34:42,399 --> 02:34:45,393
Yes, Sharon, everybody's fine.

1788
02:34:45,479 --> 02:34:46,994
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1789
02:34:49,159 --> 02:34:51,355
Well, yes, I am. Thank you for asking that.

1790
02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:56,399
<i>Rick, would you like to come up to the house
for a drink and meet my other friends?</i>

1791
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,990
Yeah, sure.

1792
02:35:05,079 --> 02:35:06,079
Thank you.

1793
02:35:06,159 --> 02:35:08,959
<i>Oh, hooray. Great. I'll buzz you up.</i>

1794
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:22,114
Come on.

1795
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:27,396
- Hey, nice to meet you, huh?
- Yeah.

1796
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:28,959
- Jay Sebring.
- Hey, pleasure.

1797
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,271
- Yeah.
- Pleasure, Jay. Pleasure's all mine.

1798
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:33,272
Sounds like you had a hell of a night.

1799
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:56,672
Hi. This is Rick Dalton,
better known as bounty hunter Jake Cahill,

1800
02:38:56,760 --> 02:39:00,230
speaking on behalf of Red Apple cigarettes.

1801
02:39:00,319 --> 02:39:03,471
Now, I smoke Red Apples.
Been smoking them for years.

1802
02:39:03,559 --> 02:39:08,510
But since the Red Apple tobacco company's
been around since 1862,

1803
02:39:08,639 --> 02:39:11,871
<i>you'll see Jake Cahill smoke Red Apple too.</i>

1804
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:17,069
<i>Now, back in Jake's day, Red Apple came
in a pouch, and he had to roll his own.</i>

1805
02:39:17,159 --> 02:39:20,119
But today, Red Apple comes factory-rolled.

1806
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:23,829
For the best drag with
the best tobacco flavor,

1807
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:29,314
with less burn on your throat than any
other non-filtered cigarette, heh-heh.

1808
02:39:34,959 --> 02:39:35,959
Mm.

1809
02:39:37,879 --> 02:39:40,520
Now, that's the way a cigarette should taste.

1810
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:41,518
Hm.

1811
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,398
Better drag, more flavor,

1812
02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:45,994
less throat burn.

1813
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:50,032
That's the Red Apple way.

1814
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,750
So look for this life-size standee of
me, Jake Cahill,

1815
02:39:54,840 --> 02:39:58,469
wherever fine Red Apple
tobacco products are sold.

1816
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:01,791
Take a bite and feel all right.

1817
02:40:01,879 --> 02:40:05,236
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

1818
02:40:05,319 --> 02:40:06,514
Tell them Jake sent you.

1819
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:12,834
- And cut.
- This cigarette tastes like fucking shit.

1820
02:40:12,920 --> 02:40:16,230
And, by the way, who chose this photo?
I have a double chin. All right?

1821
02:40:16,319 --> 02:40:17,993
Nobody notices that crap?
