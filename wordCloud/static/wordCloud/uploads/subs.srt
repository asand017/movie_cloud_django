1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,382
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,885
-You see where you're going?
-Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:13,053
Okay.

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:15,138
Now, let's worry about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,390
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,309
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:21,227
Your hips here.

8
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:22,771
Okay?

9
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,898
-Can you see?
-Yeah.

10
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:26,066
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,567
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,027
-No.
-How about now?

13
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:32,280
All right.

14
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,949
Ready?
Three fingers.

15
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:36,826
Nice!

16
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,913
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,164
Here you go.

18
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,583
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,210
Or both?

20
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,462
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,588
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,924
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,925
Got it!

24
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,010
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:55,845
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:58,223
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:58,515 --> 00:00:59,599
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:03,645
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:05,438
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,651
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,028
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

32
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:13,238
All right.

33
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,781
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:17,325
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,621
Lila?

36
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,542
Honey?

37
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,588
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:41,474
Babe?

39
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:44,728
Babe?

40
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,605
Boys!

41
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:50,358
Boys!

42
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:53,862
Laura!

43
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:38,907
You don't need to do that.

44
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,118
Because you're just holding the position.

45
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,329
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,622
That was close.

47
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,250
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

48
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,794
I would like to try again.

49
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:55,507
We're tied up. Feel the tension?

50
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,217
It's fun.

51
00:02:57,384 --> 00:02:59,386
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

52
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:01,638
And you've won.

53
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:03,890
Congratulations.

54
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:05,183
Fair game.

55
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:07,894
Good sport.

56
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:10,271
You have fun?

57
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,025
It was fun.

58
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:38,174
This thing on?

59
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:42,345
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

60
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:46,391
If you find this recording...

61
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:49,227
don't post it on social media.

62
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:51,104
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

63
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,190
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these.

64
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,401
I don't even know if you're still...

65
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:58,820
Oh, God, I hope so.

66
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,906
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

67
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,326
<i>No, 22.</i>

68
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:07,537
<i>You know, if it wasn't for the
existential terror...</i>

69
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:12,167
<i>of staring into the literal void of space,
I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.</i>

70
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:15,378
<i>Infection's run its course,
thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

71
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,547
<i>You'd love her.</i>

72
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,132
<i>Very practical.</i>

73
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,676
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

74
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,767
<i>So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...</i>

75
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,102
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

76
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,980
<i>and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.</i>

77
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,110
<i>But it's now dead in the water.</i>

78
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:42,781
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

79
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,660
<i>Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...</i>

80
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,829
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

81
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:56,211
<i>Pep, I know I said no more surprises...</i>

82
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,964
<i>but I gotta say
I was really hoping to pull off one last one.</i>

83
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:02,092
<i>But it looks like...</i>

84
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,052
<i>Well, you know what it looks like.</i>

85
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,305
Don't feel bad about this.

86
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,266
I mean, actually,
if you grovel for a couple weeks...

87
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:14,145
and then move on with enormous guilt...

88
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:23,321
I should probably lie down for a minute.
Go rest my eyes.

89
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:27,867
Please know...

90
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:32,664
when I drift off,
it'll be like every night lately.

91
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:35,834
I'm fine. Totally fine.

92
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,794
I dream about you.

93
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,964
Because it's always you.

94
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,709
Couldn't stop him.

95
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:05,877
Neither could I.

96
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,212
Hang on.

97
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,216
I lost the kid.

98
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,345
Tony, we lost.

99
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,640
Is...?

100
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,267
-Oh, good.
-Oh, my God!

101
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,311
Oh, my God!

102
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,443
It's okay.

103
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,160
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

104
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:43,873
World governments are in pieces.

105
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:45,959
The parts that are still working...

106
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:49,921
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

107
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,259
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

108
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,593
Thanos wiped out...

109
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,099
...50% of all living creatures.

110
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,355
Where is he now?
Where?

111
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,232
We don't know.

112
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,485
He just opened a portal and walked through.

113
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:16,156
What's wrong with him?

114
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,200
He's pissed.

115
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,702
He thinks he failed.

116
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,163
Which, of course, he did...

117
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,457
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

118
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:28,168
Honestly, until this exact second
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

119
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,753
Maybe I am.

120
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,296
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

121
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,465
Deep space scans...

122
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,675
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

123
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,470
Tony, you fought him.

124
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,554
Who told you that?

125
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,264
I didn't fight him.

126
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:43,016
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

127
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,602
while the Bleecker Street magician
gave away the store.

128
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,104
That's what happened.
There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable.

129
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,982
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

130
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,487
I saw this coming a few years back.

131
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,280
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

132
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,240
Thought I was dreaming.

133
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,408
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

134
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,327
And I needed you.

135
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,536
As in, past tense.

136
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:06,956
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

137
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,249
Sorry.

138
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,920
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

139
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,090
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

140
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:16,132
Tony, Tony!

141
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:21,596
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed
was a suit of armor around the world.

142
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,392
Remember that? Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

143
00:11:25,558 --> 00:11:26,768
That's what we needed.

144
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,019
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

145
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,604
I said we'd lose.

146
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:31,940
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

147
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:33,566
And guess what, Cap?

148
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,026
We lost.

149
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,486
And you weren't there.

150
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,239
But that's what we do, right?

151
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:42,158
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

152
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:44,285
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

153
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:45,453
-Okay.
-Right?

154
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,830
You made your point. Just sit down, okay?

155
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,956
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

156
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:49,499
-She's great by the way.
-Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

157
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,292
We need you. You're new blood.

158
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,296
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

159
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:55,755
I got no coordinates...

160
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,675
no clues, no strategies, no options.

161
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:00,552
Zero. Zip. Nada.

162
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,470
No trust, liar.

163
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,268
Here, take this.

164
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:10,562
You find him, you put that on...

165
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,564
you hide.

166
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,567
-Tony!
-I'm fine.

167
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,444
Let me...

168
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,243
Bruce gave him a sedative.

169
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,120
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

170
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:29,664
You guys take care of him...

171
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,374
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir
when I come back.

172
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:32,959
Where are you going?

173
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,794
To kill Thanos.

174
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,965
Hey.

175
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,259
You know, we usually work as a team here...

176
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,094
and, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

177
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,848
We realize up there is more your territory,
but this is our fight, too.

178
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,183
You even know where he is?

179
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,517
I know people who might.

180
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,019
Don't bother.

181
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,730
I can tell you where Thanos is.

182
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:59,235
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

183
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,907
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

184
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,160
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

185
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:08,745
I'd ask...

186
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,956
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

187
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,459
And his answer was always the same.

188
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,673
"To the Garden."

189
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,051
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

190
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,761
So, where is he?

191
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,180
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

192
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:31,226
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

193
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,603
No one's ever seen anything like it.

194
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,105
Until two days ago...

195
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,525
on this planet.

196
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,735
Thanos is there.

197
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,155
He used the stones again.

198
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,824
Hey, hey, hey.

199
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,201
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

200
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:49,744
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

201
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,454
So, let's get 'em.

202
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:52,998
Use them to bring everyone back.

203
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,249
Just like that?

204
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,001
Yeah. Just like that.

205
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:59,337
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

206
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,215
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

207
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:06,344
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end
any differently than it did before?

208
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,138
Because before you didn't have me.

209
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,181
Hey, new girl?

210
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,059
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

211
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,854
And if you don't mind my asking,
where the hell have you been all this time?

212
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,440
There are a lot of other planets
in the universe.

213
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,484
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

214
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,214
I like this one.

215
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,221
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

216
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:12,994
Okay.

217
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,789
Who here hasn't been to space?

218
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,291
Why?

219
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,126
You better not throw up on my ship.

220
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,586
Approaching jump in three...

221
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,838
two, one.

222
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,104
<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>

223
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,832
This is gonna work, Steve.

224
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,792
I know it will.

225
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,923
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do
if it doesn't.

226
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:11,011
<i>No satellites. No ships. No armies.</i>

227
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:12,679
<i>No ground defenses of any kind.</i>

228
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:16,433
<i>It's just him.</i>

229
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:18,810
And that's enough.

230
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,275
Oh, no.

231
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,495
Where are they?

232
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,330
Answer the question.

233
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,168
The universe required correction.

234
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:11,131
After that, the stones served no purpose...

235
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,924
beyond temptation.

236
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,051
You murdered trillions!

237
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,595
You should be grateful.

238
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,727
Where are the stones?

239
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,270
Gone.

240
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,521
Reduced to atoms.

241
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,690
You used them two days ago!

242
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,068
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

243
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,446
It nearly killed me.

244
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,615
But the work is done.

245
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,702
It always will be.

246
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,665
I am inevitable.

247
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,337
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

248
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:51,713
My father is many things.

249
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,674
A liar is not one of them.

250
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:00,013
Thank you, daughter.

251
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,809
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

252
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,317
What?

253
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,736
What did you do?

254
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,073
I went for the head.

255
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
<i>So...</i>

256
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,941
...I went on a date the other day.

257
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,776
It's the first time in five years.

258
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:39,279
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

259
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,490
I didn't even know what to talk about.

260
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,035
What did you talk about?

261
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,872
Same old crap.
You know, how things have changed.

262
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:51,124
My job, his job.

263
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,002
How much we miss the Mets.

264
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,964
And then things got quiet...

265
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,678
then he cried
as they were serving the salads.

266
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,347
What about you?

267
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,684
I cried just before dessert.

268
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,565
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

269
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,484
That's great.

270
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,235
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

271
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,529
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

272
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:26,451
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps we gotta take...

273
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,330
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

274
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,169
I went in the ice in '45,
right after I met the love of my life.

275
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,797
Woke up 70 years later.

276
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,969
You gotta move on.

277
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,306
Gotta move on.

278
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,563
The world is in our hands.

279
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,816
It's left to us, guys.

280
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,193
And we gotta do something with it.

281
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,320
Otherwise...

282
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,949
Thanos should've killed all of us.

283
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,220
What the hell?

284
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,859
Hope?

285
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,060
Kid!

286
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,269
Hey, kid!

287
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,818
What the hell happened here?

288
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,268
Oh, my God!

289
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,564
Oh, please!

290
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,274
Please, please!

291
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,443
No, no, no. No.

292
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,279
No.

293
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:52,615
Excuse me. Sorry.

294
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,075
Cassie, no.

295
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,702
No, no, no.

296
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,788
No, no.

297
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,625
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

298
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,009
What?

299
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,415
Cassie?

300
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,959
Dad?

301
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,737
You're so big!

302
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,214
<i>Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.</i>

303
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,091
<i>It was an infectious garbage scow.</i>

304
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,718
<i>So, thanks for the hot tip.</i>

305
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,219
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

306
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,679
<i>Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.</i>

307
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,180
You get a reading on those tremors?

308
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

309
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,144
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

310
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,478
<i>Nat.</i>

311
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,897
<i>It's an earthquake under the ocean.</i>

312
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,900
<i>We handle it by not handling it.</i>

313
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,778
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

314
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,948
<i>-Not likely.
-What? You gonna get another haircut?</i>

315
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,450
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

316
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,410
<i>I'm covering a lot of territory.</i>

317
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,705
<i>The things that are happening on Earth
are happening everywhere.</i>

318
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,874
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

319
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,710
<i>All right, all right. That's a good point.
That's a good point.</i>

320
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,962
<i>So, you might not see me for a long time.</i>

321
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,465
All right. Well...

322
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,468
This channel's always active.

323
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,720
So, if anything goes sideways...

324
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,306
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

325
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,641
comes through me.

326
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,267
<i>Okay.</i>

327
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,894
All right.

328
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,729
<i>Good luck.</i>

329
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,322
Where are you?

330
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,490
<i>Mexico.</i>

331
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,284
<i>The Federales found a room full of bodies.</i>

332
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,078
<i>Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...</i>

333
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,205
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

334
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,082
It's probably a rival gang.

335
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,458
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

336
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,794
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

337
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,962
<i>What he's done here...</i>

338
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,299
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

339
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,927
<i>I mean, the scene that he left...</i>

340
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,473
<i>I gotta tell you, there's a part of me
that doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

341
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,314
Will you find out where he's going next?

342
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,361
<i>Nat?</i>

343
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,864
Please?

344
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,784
<i>Okay.</i>

345
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,420
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner...

346
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,338
but you seem pretty miserable already.

347
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,844
You here to do your laundry?

348
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,595
And to see a friend.

349
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,349
Clearly, your friend is fine.

350
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,604
You know, I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming over the bridge.

351
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,606
-In the Hudson?
-There's fewer ships...

352
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,025
cleaner water.

353
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:59,112
You know, if you're about to tell me
to look on the bright side...

354
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,076
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

355
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,204
Sorry.

356
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,539
Force of habit.

357
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,931
You know, I keep telling everybody
they should move on...

358
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,767
and grow.

359
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,269
Some do.

360
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,232
But not us.

361
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,027
If I move on, who does this?

362
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,529
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

363
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,994
I used to have nothing.

364
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,081
And then I got this.

365
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,085
This job.

366
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,214
This family.

367
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,888
And I was better because of it.

368
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,690
And even though they're gone...

369
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,071
I'm still trying to be better.

370
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,535
I think we both need to get a life.

371
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,372
You first.

372
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,380
<i>Hi, hi!
Is anyone home?</i>

373
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,257
<i>This is Scott Lang.</i>

374
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,260
<i>We met a few years ago at the airport...</i>

375
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,095
<i>in Germany?</i>

376
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,556
<i>I was the guy that got really big.
I had a mask on.</i>

377
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,224
<i>-You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
-Is this an old message?

378
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,352
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

379
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,105
-It's the front gate.
<i>-I really need to talk to you guys.</i>

380
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,446
Scott.

381
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Are you okay?

382
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,574
Yeah.

383
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,745
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

384
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,663
Only to make conversation.

385
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,374
All right, so...

386
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,461
five years ago, right before...

387
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,171
Thanos...

388
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,632
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

389
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,301
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

390
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,595
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

391
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,305
Hope. She's my...

392
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,100
She was my...

393
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,020
She was supposed to pull me out.

394
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,772
And then Thanos happened...

395
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,607
and I got stuck in there.

396
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,026
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

397
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,527
Yeah, but that's just it.

398
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,862
It wasn't.

399
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,238
For me, it was five hours.

400
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,824
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

401
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,534
Everything is unpredictable.

402
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,911
Is that anybody's sandwich?

403
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,329
I'm starving.

404
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,789
Scott.

405
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,248
What are you talking about?

406
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,501
So...

407
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,045
what I'm saying is...

408
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,340
time works differently in the quantum realm.

409
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,802
The only problem is right now
we don't have a way to navigate it.

410
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:09,970
But what if we did?

411
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,932
I can't stop thinking about it.
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

412
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,225
and we could navigate it?

413
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,893
What if there was a way...

414
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,854
that we could enter the quantum realm
at a certain point in time...

415
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,732
but then exit the quantum realm
at another point in time?

416
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,234
Like...

417
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,070
-Like before Thanos.
-Wait.

418
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,822
Are you talking about a time machine?

419
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,741
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

420
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,951
This is more like a...

421
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,913
Yeah. Like a time machine.

422
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,873
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

423
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,419
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

424
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,462
some way...

425
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,423
-It's crazy.
-Scott.

426
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,882
I get emails from a raccoon...

427
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,051
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

428
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,887
So, who do we talk to about this?

429
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,073
Chow time!

430
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,577
Maguna.

431
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,374
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

432
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,753
<i>-Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.</i>
-Okay.

433
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,589
You should not be wearing that, okay?

434
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,300
That is part of a special anniversary gift
I'm making for Mom.

435
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,640
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

436
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,725
I can give you a handful of crickets
on a bed of lettuce.

437
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,602
-No.
-That's what you want.

438
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,896
How did you find this?

439
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,898
-Garage.
-Really?

440
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,067
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

441
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,819
I found it, though.

442
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,738
You like going in the garage, huh?

443
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,156
So does Daddy.

444
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,743
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

445
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,705
So, I'm gonna...

446
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,767
No. We know what it sounds like.

447
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,602
Tony, after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible?

448
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,271
Quantum fluctuation
messes with the Planck Scale...

449
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,233
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.
Can we agree on that?

450
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,484
Thank you.

451
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,778
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

452
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,363
-I did.
-No.

453
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,948
You accidentally survived.

454
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,659
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

455
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,912
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

456
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,290
A time heist?

457
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,794
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.
Why didn't we think of this before?

458
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,422
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

459
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,175
The stones are in the past.
We could go back, we could get them.

460
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,636
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

461
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,722
Or screw it up
worse than he already has, right?

462
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,889
I don't believe we would.

463
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,018
Gotta say it.
I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

464
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,603
However, high hopes won't help...

465
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,276
if there's no logical, tangible way
for me to safely execute said time heist.

466
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,279
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

467
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,324
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

468
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,076
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

469
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,786
no betting on sporting events.

470
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,705
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

471
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,876
Are you seriously telling me
that your plan to save the universe...

472
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,711
is based on <i>Back to the Future?</i>

473
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,589
-Is it?
-No.

474
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,924
Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that would be horseshit.

475
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,385
That's not how quantum physics works.

476
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,720
Tony.

477
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,140
We have to take a stand.

478
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,684
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

479
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,313
I know you got a lot on the line.

480
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,358
You got a wife, a daughter.

481
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,027
But I lost someone very important to me.

482
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,779
A lotta people did.

483
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,948
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

484
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,785
to bring everyone back,
and you're telling me that you won't even...

485
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,745
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

486
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,790
I can't.

487
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,211
Mommy told me to come and save you.

488
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,797
Good job. I'm saved.

489
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,717
I wish you were coming here to ask me
something else. Anything else.

490
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,678
I'm honestly happy to see you guys,
I just...

491
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,471
-Oh, look, the table's set for six.
-Tony.

492
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,722
I get it.

493
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,183
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

494
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,477
But this is a second chance.

495
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,605
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

496
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,315
Can't roll the dice on it.

497
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,319
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

498
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,782
Well, he's scared.

499
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,492
He's not wrong.

500
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,661
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

501
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,121
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

502
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,040
No, I wanna do it right.

503
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,920
We're gonna need a really big brain.

504
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,423
Bigger than his?

505
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,509
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one
eating here. Try some of that.

506
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:00,677
Have some eggs.

507
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,429
I'm so confused.

508
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,264
These are confusing times.

509
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,349
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

510
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,019
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

511
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,396
I know, it's crazy.

512
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,772
I'm wearing shirts now.

513
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,775
Yeah. What? How? Why?

514
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,570
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

515
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,822
Except it was worse for me...

516
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,198
'cause I lost twice.

517
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,159
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

518
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,286
and then, we all lost.

519
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,704
No one blamed you, Bruce.

520
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,247
I did.

521
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,376
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease...

522
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,003
something to get rid of.

523
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,423
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

524
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,134
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

525
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,887
I put the brains and the brawn together...

526
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,305
and now, look at me.

527
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,682
Best of both worlds.

528
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,768
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

529
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,269
Can we get a photo?

530
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,688
100%, little person.

531
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,899
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

532
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,276
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Thanks.

533
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,028
Say "green."

534
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,447
-Green.
-Green.

535
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,531
Did you get that?

536
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
That's a good one.

537
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,994
Did you want to grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

538
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,583
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man.

539
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,834
Nobody does.

540
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,544
-No, he wants you to take a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

541
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,712
Stranger danger.

542
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,422
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

543
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,633
-I get it. I don't want it, either.
-But come on. The kid...

544
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,218
I don't want a picture with them.

545
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,386
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

546
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,720
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

547
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,347
-I don't want to do it.
-We can do it.

548
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,516
-No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

549
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,850
Okay.

550
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,687
-Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
-No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

551
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,522
Hulk out!

552
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,564
Bruce.

553
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,149
Dab.

554
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,110
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

555
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,486
She knows better.

556
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,321
About what we were saying.

557
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,698
Right.

558
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,327
The whole time travel do-over?

559
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,374
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

560
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,084
Well, you pulled this off.

561
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,922
I remember a time when that seemed
pretty impossible, too.

562
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,042
I've got a mild inspiration.
I'd like to see if it checks out.

563
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,962
So, I'd like to run one last sim
before we pack it in for the night.

564
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,508
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,
inverted, please.

565
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,760
<i>Processing.</i>

566
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,724
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

567
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,893
factoring in spectral decomp.

568
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,020
-That'll take a second.
<i>-Just a moment.</i>

569
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,940
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

570
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,985
<i>Model rendered.</i>

571
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:16,623
Shit!

572
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:17,999
Shit!

573
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,130
What are you doing up, little miss?

574
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,007
-Shit.
-Nope. We don't say that.

575
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,384
Only Mommy says that word.

576
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,969
She coined it. It belongs to her.

577
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,095
Why are you up?

578
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,638
'Cause I've got some important shit
going on here!

579
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:32,973
Why do you think?

580
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,101
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

581
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,811
Was it juice pops?

582
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,563
Sure was.

583
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,733
That's extortion. That's a word.

584
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,068
What kind you want?

585
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,236
Great minds think alike.

586
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,238
Juice pops exactly...

587
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,533
was on my mind.

588
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,077
You done? Yeah?

589
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,829
Now you are.

590
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,580
Here. Wipe.

591
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,961
Good. That face goes there.

592
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,379
Tell me a story.

593
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,131
A story.

594
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,425
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

595
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,176
That is a horrible story.

596
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,095
Come on, that's your favorite story.

597
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,972
Love you tons.

598
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,809
I love you 3,000.

599
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,061
Wow.

600
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,280
3,000. That's crazy.

601
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,283
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

602
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,827
Night night.

603
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,203
Not that it's a competition...

604
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,622
but she loves me 3,000.

605
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:40,874
Does she, now?

606
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:44,085
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

607
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,635
Whatcha reading?

608
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,720
Just a book on composting.

609
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,972
What's new with composting?

610
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,476
-Interesting science...
-I figured it out.

611
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,561
By the way.

612
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,815
And, you know,
just so we're talking about the same thing...

613
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,442
Time travel.

614
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:08,943
What?

615
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,157
Wow.

616
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,788
That's amazing...

617
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,873
and terrifying.

618
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,500
That's right.

619
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,509
We got really lucky.

620
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:33,677
Yeah.

621
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:34,970
I know.

622
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,262
A lot of people didn't.

623
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,056
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

624
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,142
Sorta seems like you can.

625
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,936
Not if I stop.

626
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:46,982
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

627
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,775
Tony...

628
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,027
trying to get you to stop...

629
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,822
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life.

630
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,786
Something tells me...

631
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,748
I should put it in a lockbox
and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

632
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,167
and go to bed.

633
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,592
But would you be able to rest?

634
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:22,642
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

635
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,978
Scott, fire up...

636
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,063
the van thing.

637
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,400
Breakers are set.

638
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:32,402
Emergency generators are on standby.

639
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:37,490
Good, because if we blow the grid,
I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s.

640
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,491
Excuse me?

641
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,618
He's kidding.

642
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,746
You can't say things like that.

643
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,414
It was a bad joke.

644
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,375
You were kidding, right?

645
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,670
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

646
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,089
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

647
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,924
We're good!

648
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,426
Get your helmet on.

649
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,845
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

650
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:02,223
let you walk around for an hour,
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

651
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,391
Make sense?

652
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,310
Perfectly not confusing.

653
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,437
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

654
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,025
You're right. I do, Captain America.

655
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,528
On a count of three...

656
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:19,574
Three, two, one.

657
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,496
Guys?

658
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,831
This doesn't feel right.

659
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:27,832
What is this?

660
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:28,833
-What's going on?
-Who is that?

661
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,834
-Hold on.
-Is that Scott?

662
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:30,877
Yes, it's Scott.

663
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,299
-What's going on, Bruce?
-Oh, my back!

664
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:37,425
-What is this?
-Hold on a second.

665
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,843
-Could I get a little space here?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,887
-Can you bring him back?
-I'm working on it.

667
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:48,937
It's a baby.

668
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,647
-It's Scott.
-As a baby.

669
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,190
-He'll grow.
-Bring Scott back.

670
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,733
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

671
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,151
Oh, my God.

672
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,237
And... kill it!

673
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,451
Somebody peed my pants.

674
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,577
Oh, thank God.

675
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,956
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

676
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,253
Or just me me.

677
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,879
Time travel!

678
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,634
What?

679
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,555
I see this as an absolute win.

680
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,518
Why the long face?

681
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,437
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

682
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,690
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

683
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,275
It's the EPR Paradox.

684
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,111
Instead of pushing Lang through time,
you might've wound up...

685
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,696
pushing time through Lang.

686
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,532
It's tricky, dangerous.
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

687
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:25,659
You did.

688
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,035
Oh, did I?

689
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,870
Well, thank God I'm here.

690
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:31,289
Regardless, I fixed it.

691
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,668
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

692
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,004
I just want peace.

693
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,342
Turns out resentment is corrosive,
and I hate it.

694
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,594
Me, too.

695
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:49,307
We got a shot at getting these stones,
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

696
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,810
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

697
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,813
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

698
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,650
And maybe not die trying.

699
00:46:58,817 --> 00:46:59,859
Would be nice.

700
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,405
Sounds like a deal.

701
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,013
Tony, I don't know.

702
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,806
Why?

703
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,766
He made it for you.

704
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:35,520
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of
the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

705
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,193
Thank you, Tony.

706
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,738
Will you keep that a little quiet?

707
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:46,823
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

708
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,870
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

709
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:53,788
We're working on that right now.

710
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,932
Hey, Humie.

711
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,268
Where's Big Green?

712
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,646
The kitchen, I think.

713
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,106
That's awesome.

714
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,401
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

715
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,278
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

716
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,572
Oh, God.

717
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,200
<i>What's up, Regular-Sized Man?</i>

718
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:25,338
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

719
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,840
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

720
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,967
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

721
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:30,677
They're probably just happy to have a home.

722
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:32,554
You shouldn't have come.

723
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,640
Valkyrie!

724
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,518
Great to see you, angry girl!

725
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:40,895
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

726
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,940
-This is Rocket.
-How ya doing?

727
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,360
He won't see you.

728
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:48,737
It's that bad, huh?

729
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:53,533
We only see him once a month
when he comes in for "supplies."

730
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,744
It's that bad.

731
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,911
Yeah.

732
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,467
What the...?

733
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,597
Something died in here!

734
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,933
Hello? Thor!

735
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:21,144
Are you here about the cable?

736
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,980
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago...

737
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,317
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy
and whatnot.

738
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:29,069
Thor?

739
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,579
Boys! Oh, my God!

740
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:42,957
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

741
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,710
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

742
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,462
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

743
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:49,589
That's not necessary.

744
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:52,717
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

745
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,010
-Hey, boys!
-Hey, guys.

746
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,428
Long time no see.

747
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,847
Beer's in the bucket.
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

748
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,724
No password, obviously.

749
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,310
Thor, he's back.

750
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:05,146
That kid on the TV
just called me a dickhead again.

751
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:06,731
Noobmaster.

752
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,359
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.

753
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:10,694
I am sick of this.

754
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:14,531
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder.

755
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:16,866
Listen, bud, if you don't
log off this game immediately...

756
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:20,161
I am gonna fly over to your house, come down
to that basement you're hiding in...

757
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,956
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

758
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,376
Oh, that's right, yes!
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

759
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,086
Thank you, Thor.

760
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,587
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

761
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:30,964
Thank you very much. I will.

762
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,258
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

763
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,844
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

764
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:40,140
Buddy.

765
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,266
You all right?

766
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:42,767
Yes, I'm fine. Why?

767
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:43,977
Why, don't I look all right?

768
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:45,812
You look like melted ice cream.

769
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,899
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

770
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,359
We need your help.

771
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:54,571
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

772
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,072
What, like the cable?

773
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,450
'Cause that's been driving me
bananas for weeks.

774
00:51:58,616 --> 00:51:59,617
Like Thanos.

775
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:21,640
Don't say that name.

776
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,477
Yeah, we don't actually say that name
in here.

777
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,192
Please take your hand off me.

778
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,657
Now, I know that guy...

779
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:40,700
might scare you.

780
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,243
Why would I be...?

781
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,580
Why would I be scared of that guy?

782
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:47,582
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

783
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,794
Anyone else here kill that guy?

784
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,298
Nope.

785
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,841
Didn't think so.

786
00:52:57,926 --> 00:53:02,180
Korg, why don't you tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

787
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:03,765
Stormbreaker?

788
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:05,558
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

789
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:11,856
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

790
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,024
I've been there myself.

791
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,485
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

792
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,988
Was it Natasha?

793
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,323
It was you.

794
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,450
You helped me.

795
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,120
So, why don't you ask...

796
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,540
the Asgardians down there...

797
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,417
how much my help is worth?

798
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:37,549
The ones that are left, anyway.

799
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:39,676
I think we could bring them back.

800
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:41,594
Stop.

801
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:43,805
Stop, okay?

802
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:47,475
I know you think I'm down here
wallowing in my own self-pity...

803
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:50,186
waiting to be rescued and saved...

804
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,439
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

805
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,065
We're good here, mate.

806
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,192
So, whatever it is that you're offering,
we're not into it.

807
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,861
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

808
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:59,112
Goodbye.

809
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,200
We need you, pal.

810
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,629
There's beer on the ship.

811
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,301
What kind?

812
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:36,399
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

813
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,303
Why are you doing this?

814
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,598
We never did anything to you!

815
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:10,225
You survived...

816
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:12,352
Half the planet didn't.

817
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,270
They got Thanos.

818
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:15,855
You get me...

819
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:23,154
You're done hurting people.

820
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,324
WE hurt people?

821
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:30,787
You're crazy!

822
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,068
Wait! Help me!

823
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,030
I'll give you anything!

824
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:07,407
What do you want?

825
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:10,660
What I want you can't give me.

826
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,727
You shouldn't be here.

827
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,190
Neither should you.

828
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,656
I've got a job to do.

829
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,867
Is that what you're calling this?

830
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:54,371
Killing all these people
isn't gonna bring your family back.

831
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,294
We found something.

832
00:57:02,963 --> 00:57:05,131
A chance, maybe.

833
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,678
Don't.

834
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,055
Don't what?

835
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,559
Don't give me hope.

836
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:22,357
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

837
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,213
You're drifting left.

838
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,507
One side there, Lebowski.

839
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:52,012
Ratchet, how's it going?

840
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,179
It's Rocket.

841
00:57:53,346 --> 00:57:55,890
Take it easy.
You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

842
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:02,397
Time travel suit, not bad.

843
00:58:03,857 --> 00:58:05,275
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

844
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:06,443
I'm being very careful.

845
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,028
No, you're being very Hulky.

846
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,112
I'm being careful.

847
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,655
These are Pym Particles, all right?

848
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:13,325
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

849
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,243
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

850
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,329
-Scott, calm down.
-Sorry.

851
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:20,623
We've got enough for one round-trip each.
That's it.

852
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:21,833
No do-overs.

853
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,210
Plus two test runs.

854
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:29,215
One test run.

855
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,135
All right. I'm not ready for this.

856
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:33,595
I'm game.

857
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,557
I'll do it.

858
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:41,186
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

859
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:43,229
-Don't worry about that.
-Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

860
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:45,023
If we can do this, you know...

861
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,525
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

862
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:48,860
You know, and...

863
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,741
-First of all, that's horrible.
-It's Thanos.

864
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:57,202
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

865
00:58:57,369 --> 00:58:59,537
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

866
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,415
Look, we go back, we get the stones
before Thanos gets them...

867
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:05,335
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

868
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:07,337
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

869
00:59:07,504 --> 00:59:09,631
-Well, that's what I heard.
-Wait, but who? Who told you that?

870
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:11,591
<i>Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...</i>

871
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:13,343
<i>-Time After Time.
-Quantum Leap.</i>

872
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,553
<i>-Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.
-Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

873
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,098
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.</i>

874
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:20,350
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

875
00:59:20,517 --> 00:59:22,352
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

876
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:23,561
This is known.

877
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,981
I don't know why everyone believes that,
but that isn't true.

878
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:28,149
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

879
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,652
that past becomes your future...

880
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:33,780
and your former present
becomes the past...

881
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:36,574
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

882
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:37,951
Exactly.

883
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:41,413
So <i>Back to the Future</i> is a bunch of bullshit?

884
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:46,751
All right, Clint.

885
00:59:47,419 --> 00:59:50,463
We're going in three, two...

886
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,631
one.

887
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:05,330
Cooper?

888
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:07,040
Where are my headphones?

889
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:08,124
Lila?

890
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,377
-I never had them.
-Lila?

891
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:13,129
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

892
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,006
Lila! Lila!

893
01:01:20,512 --> 01:01:21,513
Yeah, Dad?

894
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:26,434
Dad?

895
01:01:28,937 --> 01:01:30,230
Lila!

896
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:38,488
Hey. Hey, look at me.

897
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:39,781
You okay?

898
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,534
Yeah. Yeah.

899
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:45,620
It worked.

900
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:48,748
It worked.

901
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,712
Okay, so the how works.

902
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:57,424
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

903
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:00,051
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

904
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:01,886
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

905
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:03,555
Or substitute the word "encounter"...

906
01:02:03,722 --> 01:02:06,308
for "damn near been killed"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

907
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:07,642
Well, I haven't...

908
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:10,145
but I don't even know
what the hell you're all talking about.

909
01:02:10,312 --> 01:02:15,066
Regardless, we only have enough
Pym Particles for one round-trip each.

910
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,445
And these stones have been in a lot
of different places throughout history.

911
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:19,904
Our history.

912
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:23,074
So, not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in, yeah?

913
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:25,035
Which means we have to pick our targets.

914
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,745
Correct.

915
01:02:28,121 --> 01:02:29,706
So, let's start with the Aether.

916
01:02:29,873 --> 01:02:31,082
Thor, what do you know?

917
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:37,881
Is he asleep?

918
01:02:38,048 --> 01:02:40,592
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

919
01:02:44,012 --> 01:02:45,221
Where to start?

920
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:49,559
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

921
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:51,853
Someone called it a stone before.

922
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:57,233
It's more of an angry sludge
sort of a thing...

923
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,278
so someone's gonna need to amend that
and stop saying that.

924
01:03:00,737 --> 01:03:03,281
Here's an interesting story, though,
about the Aether.

925
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:05,325
My grandfather, many years ago...

926
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:08,995
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

927
01:03:10,914 --> 01:03:11,873
Scary beings.

928
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,750
So, Jane, actually...

929
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:15,877
Oh, there she is.

930
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:19,714
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

931
01:03:20,882 --> 01:03:23,927
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

932
01:03:24,094 --> 01:03:26,930
and then the Aether stuck itself
inside her...

933
01:03:27,347 --> 01:03:29,140
and she became very, very sick.

934
01:03:29,307 --> 01:03:32,435
And so I had to take her to Asgard,
which is where I'm from...

935
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:34,562
and we had to try and fix her.

936
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,356
We were dating at the time, you see...

937
01:03:36,523 --> 01:03:39,901
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

938
01:03:41,444 --> 01:03:43,279
who's dead and...

939
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:48,243
Oh, you know, Jane and I
aren't even dating anymore, so...

940
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,495
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

941
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:51,997
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

942
01:03:52,163 --> 01:03:53,915
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

943
01:03:54,082 --> 01:03:57,127
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

944
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,171
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

945
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,382
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

946
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:04,676
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

947
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:08,471
-Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

948
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,557
Quill was a person.

949
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:13,643
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

950
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:18,023
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

951
01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:21,359
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

952
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:22,652
I'll take you to space.

953
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:25,947
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

954
01:04:26,114 --> 01:04:28,074
What is Vormir?

955
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:29,409
A dominion of death...

956
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:31,995
at the very center of celestial existence.

957
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:37,917
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

958
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:45,383
Not it.

959
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:48,762
-That Time Stone guy.
-Doctor Strange.

960
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:50,722
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

961
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:52,849
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

962
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:54,309
Nice place in the Village, though.

963
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:56,061
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

964
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:57,228
Bleecker Street.

965
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:58,480
Wait, he lived in New York?

966
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:01,191
-No, he lived in Toronto.
-Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

967
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:03,151
-Have you been listening to anything?
-Guys.

968
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:06,863
If you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

969
01:05:09,324 --> 01:05:11,034
Shut the front door.

970
01:05:13,787 --> 01:05:15,914
All right. We have a plan.

971
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:20,669
Six stones, three teams, one shot.

972
01:05:30,387 --> 01:05:32,263
<i>Five years ago, we lost.</i>

973
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:34,891
<i>All of us.</i>

974
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,186
<i>We lost friends.</i>

975
01:05:38,895 --> 01:05:40,563
<i>We lost family.</i>

976
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:44,359
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

977
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:48,154
<i>Today, we have a chance to take it all back.</i>

978
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:52,409
<i>You know your teams. You know your missions.</i>

979
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:55,161
<i>Get the stones. Get them back.</i>

980
01:05:55,996 --> 01:05:57,163
One round-trip each.

981
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,415
No mistakes...

982
01:05:58,915 --> 01:06:00,625
no do-overs.

983
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:02,669
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

984
01:06:02,836 --> 01:06:04,671
That doesn't mean we should know
what to expect.

985
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:06,840
Be careful.

986
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:08,758
Look out for each other.

987
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:12,012
This is the fight of our lives...

988
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,472
and we're gonna win.

989
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:17,642
Whatever it takes.

990
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,355
Good luck.

991
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:23,606
He's pretty good at that.

992
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:24,941
-Right?
-All right.

993
01:06:25,108 --> 01:06:27,444
You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

994
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:29,946
Trackers engaged.

995
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:32,574
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

996
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:34,075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:36,119
Okay, I'll do my best.

998
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:38,079
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

999
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,292
See ya in a minute.

1000
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,014
All right, we all have our assignments.

1001
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:40,392
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1002
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:42,519
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1003
01:07:57,951 --> 01:07:59,744
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1004
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,872
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1005
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:33,778
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

1006
01:08:39,117 --> 01:08:40,744
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1007
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:45,206
You're about five years too early.

1008
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:49,711
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery about 20 blocks that way.

1009
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:52,505
What do you want from him?

1010
01:08:53,423 --> 01:08:54,424
That, actually.

1011
01:08:57,802 --> 01:08:58,637
I'm afraid not.

1012
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:00,430
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1013
01:09:01,348 --> 01:09:02,349
You don't want to do this.

1014
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:04,100
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1015
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,769
and I don't have time to debate it.

1016
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:16,363
Let's start over, shall we?

1017
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:29,417
For you, Lady Jane.

1018
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,961
Do you have anything with pants?

1019
01:09:32,128 --> 01:09:33,171
Pants?

1020
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:35,423
Never mind. These will be fine.
Thank you.

1021
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,217
-Yes, milady.
-There's Jane.

1022
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:39,844
All right.

1023
01:09:41,429 --> 01:09:42,681
Here's the deal, tubby.

1024
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:45,225
You're gonna charm her,
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing...

1025
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:47,852
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1026
01:09:49,604 --> 01:09:52,565
I'll be right back, okay?
The wine cellar is just down here.

1027
01:09:52,732 --> 01:09:55,610
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1028
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:57,028
I'll see if the scullery has a couple
of to-go cups.

1029
01:09:57,195 --> 01:09:59,072
Hey. Hey!
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1030
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:08,373
-If you could send Loki some soup.
-Yes, milady.

1031
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,544
And ask our librarians to pull
some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1032
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:20,260
Who's the fancy broad?

1033
01:10:21,594 --> 01:10:23,096
That's my mother.

1034
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:25,307
She dies today.

1035
01:10:25,974 --> 01:10:27,767
Oh, that is today?

1036
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,860
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1037
01:10:37,444 --> 01:10:38,987
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1038
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:40,280
It's a bad idea!

1039
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:41,614
-Come here.
-No, no, no.

1040
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:44,200
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1041
01:10:44,367 --> 01:10:46,369
-Come here. Right here.
-I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

1042
01:10:47,162 --> 01:10:48,788
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1043
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:50,790
What do you think we're doing here?

1044
01:10:50,957 --> 01:10:53,126
I lost the only family I ever had.

1045
01:10:53,293 --> 01:10:55,712
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1046
01:10:55,879 --> 01:10:57,297
all gone.

1047
01:10:58,006 --> 01:10:59,341
I get you miss your mom...

1048
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:00,842
but she's gone.

1049
01:11:01,009 --> 01:11:02,010
Really gone.

1050
01:11:02,594 --> 01:11:05,430
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1051
01:11:05,597 --> 01:11:06,723
and you can help them.

1052
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:11,061
So, is it too much to ask that
you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1053
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,521
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1054
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,858
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1055
01:11:17,025 --> 01:11:18,610
and help me get my family back?

1056
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:21,279
Okay.

1057
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:22,572
Are you crying?

1058
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,491
No.

1059
01:11:26,326 --> 01:11:27,494
Yes.

1060
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:28,870
I feel like I'm losing it.

1061
01:11:29,037 --> 01:11:30,038
Get it together!

1062
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:31,206
You can do this.

1063
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,708
You can do this.

1064
01:11:36,878 --> 01:11:37,879
All right?

1065
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:39,047
Yes, I can.

1066
01:11:39,214 --> 01:11:40,215
Good.

1067
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:44,761
I can do this. I can do this.

1068
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:47,055
I can't do this.

1069
01:11:47,222 --> 01:11:50,642
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.
This is our shot.

1070
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:53,395
Thor? Thor!

1071
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,031
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1072
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:07,617
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1073
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:13,957
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1074
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:16,209
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1075
01:12:16,376 --> 01:12:18,128
All that is really helpful.

1076
01:12:20,338 --> 01:12:21,840
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

1077
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:24,467
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1078
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,678
-Hey.
-We got this.

1079
01:12:26,845 --> 01:12:28,054
-Let's get it done.
-Yes, sir.

1080
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:29,514
I'll see you back.

1081
01:12:30,223 --> 01:12:31,558
You guys watch each other's six.

1082
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:33,476
Yeah.

1083
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:43,695
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1084
01:12:45,322 --> 01:12:47,240
All they have to do is not fall out.

1085
01:12:53,163 --> 01:12:55,540
We're a long way from Budapest.

1086
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,921
Okay, so...

1087
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:06,384
we just wait around
for this Quill guy to show up...

1088
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:08,386
and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?

1089
01:13:09,387 --> 01:13:10,805
Let's take cover.

1090
01:13:12,432 --> 01:13:14,893
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

1091
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,311
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1092
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:17,812
Who else is looking for these stones?

1093
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:22,859
My father...

1094
01:13:23,026 --> 01:13:24,819
my sister...

1095
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,112
and me.

1096
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:27,447
And you?

1097
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:30,909
Where are you right now?

1098
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:00,772
You're welcome.

1099
01:14:00,939 --> 01:14:03,233
I didn't ask for your help.

1100
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,527
And yet, you always need it.

1101
01:14:09,572 --> 01:14:11,574
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1102
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:12,742
Why?

1103
01:14:12,909 --> 01:14:14,911
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1104
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:20,834
Where?

1105
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:22,752
On a planet called Morag.

1106
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:26,298
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1107
01:14:26,464 --> 01:14:28,466
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1108
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:29,843
It's a start.

1109
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,803
If he gets all of them...

1110
01:14:44,816 --> 01:14:48,361
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1111
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:49,738
He won't like that.

1112
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:52,032
His alternative is death.

1113
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,285
Ronan's obsession...

1114
01:14:56,328 --> 01:14:58,496
clouds his judgment.

1115
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,711
We will not fail you, Father.

1116
01:15:05,754 --> 01:15:07,380
No, you won't.

1117
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:11,092
I swear...

1118
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:14,888
I will make you proud.

1119
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:26,941
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

1120
01:15:27,108 --> 01:15:29,110
<i>and then he leads us
to the Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1121
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:30,862
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1122
01:15:31,863 --> 01:15:34,741
<i>We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.</i>

1123
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,620
Who was that?

1124
01:15:38,787 --> 01:15:39,788
I don't know.

1125
01:15:39,954 --> 01:15:42,123
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1126
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,544
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1127
01:15:56,805 --> 01:15:58,848
Bring her to my ship.

1128
01:16:06,481 --> 01:16:07,315
Better hustle, Cap.

1129
01:16:07,482 --> 01:16:09,567
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1130
01:16:09,734 --> 01:16:11,361
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

1131
01:16:17,826 --> 01:16:19,411
If it's all the same to you...

1132
01:16:21,705 --> 01:16:23,248
I'll have that drink now.

1133
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,250
All right, get him on his feet.

1134
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:28,420
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1135
01:16:28,586 --> 01:16:29,921
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1136
01:16:30,839 --> 01:16:33,091
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that
that suit...

1137
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:35,176
did nothing for your ass.

1138
01:16:35,343 --> 01:16:36,469
<i>No one asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1139
01:16:36,636 --> 01:16:38,263
-It's ridiculous.
<i>-I think you look great, Cap.</i>

1140
01:16:38,722 --> 01:16:41,224
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1141
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:43,351
Who gets the magic wand?

1142
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:44,561
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it.

1143
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:57,490
We can take that off your hands.

1144
01:16:57,657 --> 01:16:58,658
By all means.

1145
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,620
Careful with that thing.

1146
01:17:02,787 --> 01:17:04,247
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1147
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:05,415
And not in a fun way.

1148
01:17:05,582 --> 01:17:06,583
We promise to be careful.

1149
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,751
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1150
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:09,210
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1151
01:17:09,377 --> 01:17:12,464
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1152
01:17:12,631 --> 01:17:14,799
<i>Seriously? You didn't?</i>

1153
01:17:14,966 --> 01:17:16,468
<i>I mean, they look like bad guys.</i>

1154
01:17:16,635 --> 01:17:18,053
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1155
01:17:18,219 --> 01:17:20,055
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1156
01:17:20,221 --> 01:17:22,182
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1157
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:24,809
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1158
01:17:24,976 --> 01:17:26,394
Shut up.

1159
01:17:26,978 --> 01:17:28,271
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1160
01:17:28,438 --> 01:17:30,565
There's our stone.

1161
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:31,733
<i>All right.</i>

1162
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,068
<i>Flick me.</i>

1163
01:17:47,165 --> 01:17:48,166
-Move.
-Hey.

1164
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:50,085
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1165
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:52,045
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1166
01:17:52,212 --> 01:17:53,213
Take the stairs.

1167
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,256
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1168
01:17:58,009 --> 01:18:00,804
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1169
01:18:04,516 --> 01:18:06,893
All right, Cap, I got our scepter
in the elevator...

1170
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,853
just passing the 80th floor.

1171
01:18:09,646 --> 01:18:10,647
On it.

1172
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:13,358
-Head to the lobby.
<i>-All right, I'll see you there.</i>

1173
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:15,318
Evidence secure.

1174
01:18:15,485 --> 01:18:16,903
We're en route to Doctor List.

1175
01:18:17,612 --> 01:18:20,490
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1176
01:18:25,912 --> 01:18:26,663
Captain.

1177
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,873
I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue.

1178
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,583
Change of plans.

1179
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:35,839
Hey, Cap.

1180
01:18:37,132 --> 01:18:38,174
Rumlow.

1181
01:18:44,472 --> 01:18:46,308
I just got a call from the secretary.

1182
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:48,351
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1183
01:18:50,854 --> 01:18:53,106
Sir?
I don't understand.

1184
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:57,402
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1185
01:18:57,569 --> 01:18:59,154
Sorry, Cap.

1186
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:00,739
We can't give you the scepter.

1187
01:19:01,323 --> 01:19:03,199
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1188
01:19:03,366 --> 01:19:05,493
That's okay. Trust me.

1189
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,998
Hail Hydra.

1190
01:19:24,721 --> 01:19:26,598
So many stairs!

1191
01:19:38,318 --> 01:19:40,945
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1192
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:42,197
It is go time.

1193
01:19:42,364 --> 01:19:43,365
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1194
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:52,999
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1195
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,377
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1196
01:19:55,543 --> 01:19:56,628
Can we focus, please?

1197
01:19:56,795 --> 01:19:58,046
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1198
01:19:58,755 --> 01:19:59,756
<i>now.</i>

1199
01:20:05,637 --> 01:20:07,097
May I ask you where you're going?

1200
01:20:07,263 --> 01:20:09,516
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1201
01:20:09,683 --> 01:20:10,684
Alexander Pierce.

1202
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:13,311
He's the man above the folks
behind Nick Fury.

1203
01:20:13,478 --> 01:20:14,604
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1204
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:17,148
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn
that prisoner over to me.

1205
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:19,109
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1206
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:21,653
No, he's going to answer to us.
Odin can have what's left.

1207
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,279
And I'm gonna need that case.

1208
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:25,240
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property
for over 70 years.

1209
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:26,616
Hand over the case, Stark.

1210
01:20:26,783 --> 01:20:29,160
All right, move it, Stuart Little.
Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1211
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,037
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1212
01:20:31,496 --> 01:20:32,789
<i>You promise me you won't die?</i>

1213
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:35,667
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1214
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:37,419
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1215
01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:38,586
I need the case.

1216
01:20:38,753 --> 01:20:40,130
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying, jurisdiction...

1217
01:20:40,297 --> 01:20:41,464
Okay, then give me the case.

1218
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:43,675
-Well, jurisdiction...
-Hand it over.

1219
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:44,759
Do it, Lang!

1220
01:20:44,926 --> 01:20:46,720
-Get your hands off me.
-Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1221
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:49,139
<i>Here goes!</i>

1222
01:20:51,975 --> 01:20:53,518
-Stark?
-Stark?

1223
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:55,937
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1224
01:20:56,104 --> 01:20:57,814
-Medic!
-Medic!

1225
01:20:58,356 --> 01:20:59,733
Give these guys some help.

1226
01:21:00,108 --> 01:21:01,109
Speak to me.

1227
01:21:01,568 --> 01:21:03,361
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1228
01:21:06,114 --> 01:21:07,449
Breathe, breathe.

1229
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,040
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1230
01:21:20,754 --> 01:21:22,464
No stairs!

1231
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,098
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1232
01:21:32,265 --> 01:21:34,225
I'm going to try something. Okay?
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1233
01:21:36,227 --> 01:21:37,103
Yes!

1234
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,647
Oh, that worked a treat.

1235
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:39,814
Dude, that was so crazy.

1236
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:41,358
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1237
01:21:41,524 --> 01:21:43,401
-The case.
-The case is...

1238
01:21:43,568 --> 01:21:45,570
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1239
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:47,572
Loki!

1240
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:48,907
<i>That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?</i>

1241
01:21:49,074 --> 01:21:50,200
We blew it.

1242
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:51,868
Loki?

1243
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:55,205
Tony, what's going on?

1244
01:21:56,206 --> 01:21:57,874
Tell me you found that Cube.

1245
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:02,170
You gotta be shitting me.

1246
01:22:06,257 --> 01:22:08,468
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1247
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:10,011
I'm not Loki...

1248
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:15,225
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1249
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,151
I can do this all day.

1250
01:22:25,318 --> 01:22:26,611
Yeah, I know.

1251
01:22:26,778 --> 01:22:27,779
I know.

1252
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,521
Where did you get this?

1253
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:15,869
Bucky is alive.

1254
01:23:19,414 --> 01:23:20,457
What?

1255
01:23:35,388 --> 01:23:36,931
That is America's ass.

1256
01:23:41,311 --> 01:23:42,312
Please, please.

1257
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:44,356
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce.

1258
01:23:45,398 --> 01:23:48,526
If I give up the Time Stone
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1259
01:23:48,693 --> 01:23:50,445
With all due respect, all right...

1260
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:53,698
I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

1261
01:23:59,329 --> 01:24:03,625
The Infinity Stones create
what you experience as the flow of time.

1262
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:05,335
Remove one of the stones...

1263
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:07,587
and that flow splits.

1264
01:24:07,754 --> 01:24:10,215
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1265
01:24:10,382 --> 01:24:12,509
but my new one, not so much.

1266
01:24:12,884 --> 01:24:14,594
In this new branch reality...

1267
01:24:14,761 --> 01:24:17,847
without our chief weapon against
the forces of darkness...

1268
01:24:18,264 --> 01:24:20,183
our world would be overrun.

1269
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:22,060
Millions will suffer.

1270
01:24:22,227 --> 01:24:23,478
So, tell me, Doctor.

1271
01:24:24,062 --> 01:24:26,231
Can your science prevent all that?

1272
01:24:26,398 --> 01:24:27,399
No...

1273
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,526
but we can erase it.

1274
01:24:29,693 --> 01:24:31,403
Because once we're done with the stones...

1275
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:33,738
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1276
01:24:33,905 --> 01:24:35,407
at the moment it was taken.

1277
01:24:35,573 --> 01:24:38,034
So, chronologically...

1278
01:24:39,077 --> 01:24:40,120
in that reality...

1279
01:24:42,706 --> 01:24:44,374
it never left.

1280
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:49,838
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1281
01:24:53,425 --> 01:24:55,885
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1282
01:24:56,052 --> 01:24:58,638
We will. I will. I promise.

1283
01:24:59,472 --> 01:25:01,516
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1284
01:25:03,184 --> 01:25:07,814
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme
to protect the Time Stone.

1285
01:25:08,189 --> 01:25:10,066
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1286
01:25:12,027 --> 01:25:13,111
What did you say?

1287
01:25:13,278 --> 01:25:15,613
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1288
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,824
-Willingly?
-Yes.

1289
01:25:21,745 --> 01:25:23,330
-Why?
-I have no idea.

1290
01:25:23,496 --> 01:25:25,248
Maybe he made a mistake.

1291
01:25:35,383 --> 01:25:36,676
Or I did.

1292
01:25:56,946 --> 01:25:59,366
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1293
01:25:59,532 --> 01:26:02,035
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1294
01:26:02,827 --> 01:26:04,454
I fear you might be right.

1295
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:10,627
Thank you.

1296
01:26:16,883 --> 01:26:18,551
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1297
01:26:20,595 --> 01:26:21,805
We all are.

1298
01:26:42,283 --> 01:26:43,827
Run diagnostics.

1299
01:26:44,577 --> 01:26:46,538
Show me her memory file.

1300
01:26:48,123 --> 01:26:50,583
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1301
01:26:51,751 --> 01:26:53,712
It was a memory, but not hers.

1302
01:26:54,963 --> 01:26:56,381
There's another consciousness...

1303
01:26:56,548 --> 01:26:57,841
sharing her network.

1304
01:26:58,383 --> 01:26:59,718
Another Nebula.

1305
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:03,305
Impossible.

1306
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:06,099
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1307
01:27:07,017 --> 01:27:09,185
from nine years in the future.

1308
01:27:13,773 --> 01:27:16,276
Where is this other Nebula?

1309
01:27:16,943 --> 01:27:18,945
In our solar system on Morag.

1310
01:27:20,488 --> 01:27:21,781
Can you access her?

1311
01:27:21,948 --> 01:27:23,992
Yes, the two are linked.

1312
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,244
Search the duplicate's memories...

1313
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:28,621
for Infinity Stones.

1314
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:35,128
<i>And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.</i>

1315
01:27:35,295 --> 01:27:36,296
<i>Our history.</i>

1316
01:27:36,463 --> 01:27:38,590
<i>So, not a lot of convenient spots...</i>

1317
01:27:38,757 --> 01:27:39,883
<i>to just drop in.</i>

1318
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:41,718
<i>Which means we have to pick our targets.</i>

1319
01:27:41,885 --> 01:27:43,178
<i>-Correct.</i>
-Freeze image.

1320
01:27:45,138 --> 01:27:46,348
Terrans.

1321
01:27:47,432 --> 01:27:49,100
Avengers.

1322
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:51,895
Unruly wretches.

1323
01:27:52,062 --> 01:27:53,563
What's that reflection?

1324
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,358
Amplify this, Maw.

1325
01:27:59,861 --> 01:28:01,071
I don't understand.

1326
01:28:05,784 --> 01:28:07,369
Two Nebulas.

1327
01:28:07,535 --> 01:28:09,954
No.
The same Nebula...

1328
01:28:10,747 --> 01:28:12,499
from two different times.

1329
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:15,418
Set course for Morag.

1330
01:28:15,585 --> 01:28:17,962
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1331
01:28:18,713 --> 01:28:21,091
I wanna see everything.

1332
01:28:30,892 --> 01:28:34,354
My ladies, I'll see you after.
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1333
01:28:48,743 --> 01:28:49,744
What are you doing?

1334
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:52,580
Oh, God!

1335
01:28:52,747 --> 01:28:55,208
You're better off
leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1336
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:57,252
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1337
01:28:57,419 --> 01:28:58,753
What are you wearing?

1338
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,297
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1339
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:06,761
What's wrong with your eye?

1340
01:29:06,928 --> 01:29:07,929
Oh, my eye.

1341
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,056
Remember the Battle of Harokin...

1342
01:29:10,223 --> 01:29:13,310
when I got hit in the face
with the broadsword?

1343
01:29:16,855 --> 01:29:18,898
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1344
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:21,401
Yes, I am.

1345
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:24,404
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1346
01:29:24,863 --> 01:29:26,781
I didn't say I was from the future.

1347
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,784
I was raised by witches, boy.

1348
01:29:30,827 --> 01:29:33,204
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1349
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,542
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1350
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:39,336
Yes, you are, honey.

1351
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:41,004
I really need to talk to you.

1352
01:29:41,171 --> 01:29:42,172
We can talk.

1353
01:30:06,321 --> 01:30:08,281
His head was over there...

1354
01:30:08,907 --> 01:30:11,409
and his body over there...

1355
01:30:12,702 --> 01:30:15,205
I mean, what was the point?
I was too late.

1356
01:30:15,872 --> 01:30:17,499
I was just standing there.

1357
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,210
Some idiot with an axe.

1358
01:30:20,377 --> 01:30:22,087
Now, you're no idiot.

1359
01:30:23,213 --> 01:30:24,798
You're here, aren't you?

1360
01:30:25,006 --> 01:30:27,467
Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1361
01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:28,843
I am. Yes.

1362
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:30,345
Idiot, no.

1363
01:30:30,512 --> 01:30:32,013
A failure?

1364
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,306
Absolutely.

1365
01:30:33,473 --> 01:30:35,266
That's a little bit harsh.

1366
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:36,935
Do you know what that makes you?

1367
01:30:38,144 --> 01:30:40,146
Just like everyone else.

1368
01:30:40,313 --> 01:30:43,191
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1369
01:30:43,692 --> 01:30:46,861
Everyone fails
at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1370
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:50,615
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1371
01:30:50,782 --> 01:30:54,160
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1372
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,875
I've really missed you, Mom.

1373
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:08,508
Thor! I got it!

1374
01:31:09,384 --> 01:31:10,927
Get that rabbit!

1375
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:15,515
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1376
01:31:15,682 --> 01:31:17,475
No, son, you don't.

1377
01:31:17,642 --> 01:31:20,145
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1378
01:31:20,312 --> 01:31:21,980
This is about your future.

1379
01:31:22,147 --> 01:31:23,481
It's none of my business.

1380
01:31:27,485 --> 01:31:28,737
Hi.

1381
01:31:28,903 --> 01:31:30,905
You must be Mom.

1382
01:31:31,072 --> 01:31:32,532
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1383
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:34,159
I wish we had more time.

1384
01:31:34,326 --> 01:31:36,161
No, this was a gift.

1385
01:31:36,328 --> 01:31:39,748
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1386
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:41,291
I love you, Mom.

1387
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:42,375
I love you.

1388
01:31:46,838 --> 01:31:48,757
And eat a salad.

1389
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:50,884
Come on, we gotta go.

1390
01:31:51,051 --> 01:31:52,636
-Goodbye.
-Three...

1391
01:31:52,802 --> 01:31:53,887
-Two...
-No, wait!

1392
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,350
What am I looking at?

1393
01:31:58,516 --> 01:31:59,976
Sometimes it takes a second.

1394
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:11,488
I'm still worthy.

1395
01:32:12,906 --> 01:32:14,532
Oh, boy.

1396
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,619
-Goodbye, Mom.
-Goodbye.

1397
01:32:56,866 --> 01:32:58,493
So, he's an idiot?

1398
01:32:59,828 --> 01:33:01,246
Yeah.

1399
01:33:09,754 --> 01:33:10,964
What's that?

1400
01:33:11,131 --> 01:33:13,008
The tool of a thief.

1401
01:33:22,767 --> 01:33:24,394
This is the part where spikes come out...

1402
01:33:24,561 --> 01:33:25,979
with skeletons on the end of them
and everything.

1403
01:33:26,146 --> 01:33:27,355
What are you talking about?

1404
01:33:27,522 --> 01:33:29,858
When you break into a place called
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1405
01:33:30,025 --> 01:33:31,318
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1406
01:33:31,484 --> 01:33:33,737
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1407
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,521
I wasn't always like this.

1408
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:10,440
Me either.

1409
01:34:12,233 --> 01:34:13,693
But we work with what we got, right?

1410
01:34:17,447 --> 01:34:19,115
Let's sync up.

1411
01:34:20,992 --> 01:34:23,453
Three, two, one.

1412
01:34:36,299 --> 01:34:37,926
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1413
01:34:38,093 --> 01:34:39,511
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1414
01:34:41,137 --> 01:34:42,722
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1415
01:34:42,889 --> 01:34:43,890
<i>Gone.</i>

1416
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:45,642
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1417
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:48,019
<i>You used them two days ago!</i>

1418
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:51,314
<i>I used the stones to destroy the stones.</i>

1419
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:53,316
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1420
01:34:53,483 --> 01:34:55,402
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1421
01:34:55,568 --> 01:34:57,404
<i>It always will be.</i>

1422
01:34:58,697 --> 01:35:02,158
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1423
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:05,453
What did you do to them?

1424
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,871
Nothing.

1425
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:09,040
Yet.

1426
01:35:10,834 --> 01:35:14,546
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1427
01:35:14,879 --> 01:35:18,508
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1428
01:35:18,675 --> 01:35:20,343
The stones.

1429
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:23,179
I found them all.

1430
01:35:24,973 --> 01:35:26,349
I won.

1431
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,061
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1432
01:35:34,065 --> 01:35:35,817
This is your future.

1433
01:35:36,151 --> 01:35:38,194
It's my destiny.

1434
01:35:39,404 --> 01:35:41,448
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1435
01:35:41,614 --> 01:35:43,450
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1436
01:35:47,162 --> 01:35:49,080
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1437
01:35:49,247 --> 01:35:51,416
<i>Perhaps I treated you too harshly.</i>

1438
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,798
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1439
01:35:59,215 --> 01:36:00,592
Sire...

1440
01:36:00,759 --> 01:36:01,885
your daughter...

1441
01:36:04,346 --> 01:36:05,347
No!

1442
01:36:05,805 --> 01:36:06,848
...is a traitor.

1443
01:36:07,015 --> 01:36:09,476
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1444
01:36:09,643 --> 01:36:10,810
I would never betray you.

1445
01:36:10,977 --> 01:36:12,812
Never. Never.

1446
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:19,736
I know.

1447
01:36:20,695 --> 01:36:23,948
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1448
01:36:30,246 --> 01:36:31,331
No!

1449
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,249
He knows!

1450
01:36:37,837 --> 01:36:39,881
Barton! Barton, come in.

1451
01:36:40,507 --> 01:36:41,800
Romanoff!

1452
01:36:42,425 --> 01:36:43,843
Come in, we have a problem.

1453
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:45,136
Come on!

1454
01:36:45,303 --> 01:36:46,721
Come in, we have a...

1455
01:36:46,888 --> 01:36:48,223
Thanos knows.

1456
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:50,141
Thanos...

1457
01:37:03,863 --> 01:37:04,948
Cap.

1458
01:37:06,574 --> 01:37:08,827
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1459
01:37:09,661 --> 01:37:10,996
Yeah, we do.

1460
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:12,580
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1461
01:37:12,747 --> 01:37:13,748
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1462
01:37:13,915 --> 01:37:15,333
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1463
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,918
You said that we had one shot.

1464
01:37:17,085 --> 01:37:18,420
This was our shot.

1465
01:37:18,586 --> 01:37:20,588
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1466
01:37:20,755 --> 01:37:22,132
-It was six stones or nothing.
-You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1467
01:37:22,299 --> 01:37:23,300
You're repeating yourself.

1468
01:37:23,466 --> 01:37:25,176
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1469
01:37:25,343 --> 01:37:27,137
-Dude. Come on!
-No. You never wanted a time heist.

1470
01:37:27,304 --> 01:37:28,305
You weren't on board with the time heist.

1471
01:37:28,471 --> 01:37:29,597
-I dropped the ball.
-You ruined the time heist.

1472
01:37:29,764 --> 01:37:31,057
-Is that what I did?
-Yeah.

1473
01:37:31,224 --> 01:37:33,018
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1474
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,394
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1475
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:35,812
There's no do-overs.

1476
01:37:35,979 --> 01:37:38,064
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1477
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:39,065
Each.

1478
01:37:39,232 --> 01:37:41,526
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1479
01:37:41,693 --> 01:37:42,861
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1480
01:37:43,028 --> 01:37:44,988
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1481
01:37:45,155 --> 01:37:46,323
then no one else is going home, either.

1482
01:37:46,489 --> 01:37:47,407
I got it.

1483
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:52,746
There's another way to retake the Tesseract
and acquire new particles.

1484
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:54,622
Little stroll down memory lane.

1485
01:37:55,415 --> 01:37:57,250
Military installation, Garden State.

1486
01:38:01,338 --> 01:38:02,631
When were they both there?

1487
01:38:02,797 --> 01:38:05,175
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1488
01:38:05,842 --> 01:38:06,843
-How vague?
-What are you talking about?

1489
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:07,886
Where are we going?

1490
01:38:08,053 --> 01:38:08,970
I know for a fact they were there.

1491
01:38:09,137 --> 01:38:10,847
-Who's they? What are we doing?
-And I know how I know.

1492
01:38:13,224 --> 01:38:14,768
Guys, what is it?

1493
01:38:15,352 --> 01:38:16,978
Looks like we're improvising.

1494
01:38:17,145 --> 01:38:18,271
-Great.
-What are we improvising?

1495
01:38:18,438 --> 01:38:20,190
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1496
01:38:20,357 --> 01:38:21,274
Suit up.

1497
01:38:21,608 --> 01:38:23,068
-What's in New Jersey?
-0-4.

1498
01:38:23,234 --> 01:38:24,069
0-4.

1499
01:38:24,235 --> 01:38:25,236
-0-7.
-0-7.

1500
01:38:25,403 --> 01:38:27,280
-Excuse me.
-1-9-7-0.

1501
01:38:27,739 --> 01:38:28,657
Are you sure?

1502
01:38:28,823 --> 01:38:30,116
Cap?
Captain?

1503
01:38:30,283 --> 01:38:32,118
Steve? Sorry.

1504
01:38:32,285 --> 01:38:33,912
America. Rogers.

1505
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:35,288
Look, if you do this...

1506
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,124
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1507
01:38:39,209 --> 01:38:41,002
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1508
01:38:42,045 --> 01:38:43,254
You trust me?

1509
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:45,298
I do.

1510
01:38:46,341 --> 01:38:47,676
Your call.

1511
01:38:48,551 --> 01:38:50,261
Here we go.

1512
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:09,948
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1513
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:18,540
Clearly you weren't actually
born here, right?

1514
01:39:18,707 --> 01:39:20,208
The idea of me was.

1515
01:39:21,376 --> 01:39:22,919
Right.
Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1516
01:39:23,086 --> 01:39:26,339
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1517
01:39:27,674 --> 01:39:29,259
where do you hide it?

1518
01:39:29,426 --> 01:39:31,094
In plain sight.

1519
01:39:59,497 --> 01:40:00,623
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1520
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:03,335
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1521
01:40:06,755 --> 01:40:07,839
You new here?

1522
01:40:10,383 --> 01:40:11,718
Not exactly.

1523
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:20,185
Come on, you bastard.

1524
01:40:26,983 --> 01:40:28,485
Gotcha.

1525
01:40:46,044 --> 01:40:47,712
Back in the game.

1526
01:40:50,382 --> 01:40:51,591
Arnim, you in there?

1527
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,593
Arnim?

1528
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,225
Hey!

1529
01:41:00,892 --> 01:41:02,602
The door is this way, pal.

1530
01:41:03,603 --> 01:41:04,479
Oh, yeah.

1531
01:41:04,646 --> 01:41:06,523
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1532
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:10,110
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1533
01:41:11,611 --> 01:41:12,946
Pardon me.

1534
01:41:13,697 --> 01:41:15,323
Do I know you?

1535
01:41:16,574 --> 01:41:17,575
No, sir.

1536
01:41:19,035 --> 01:41:20,829
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1537
01:41:21,413 --> 01:41:22,539
MIT.

1538
01:41:22,998 --> 01:41:24,124
Got a name?

1539
01:41:24,582 --> 01:41:25,709
Howard.

1540
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:28,378
-That'll be easy to remember.
-Howard...

1541
01:41:29,379 --> 01:41:30,380
Potts.

1542
01:41:30,964 --> 01:41:33,174
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1543
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:34,259
Hi.

1544
01:41:34,426 --> 01:41:35,719
Shake that, don't pull it.

1545
01:41:35,885 --> 01:41:36,886
Yeah.

1546
01:41:38,305 --> 01:41:40,515
You look a little green
around the gills, there, Potts.

1547
01:41:40,682 --> 01:41:42,851
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1548
01:41:43,018 --> 01:41:44,728
You wanna get some air?

1549
01:41:47,272 --> 01:41:49,065
-Hello, Potts.
-Yeah.

1550
01:41:49,232 --> 01:41:50,483
-That'd be swell.
-That way.

1551
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:51,609
Okay.

1552
01:41:51,776 --> 01:41:53,445
Need your briefcase?

1553
01:41:57,782 --> 01:42:00,368
You're not one of those beatniks,
are you, Potts?

1554
01:42:06,207 --> 01:42:08,001
-Hello?
<i>-Doctor Pym?</i>

1555
01:42:08,168 --> 01:42:10,378
That would be the number
that you called, yes.

1556
01:42:10,545 --> 01:42:12,797
<i>This is Captain Stevens from shipping.</i>

1557
01:42:12,964 --> 01:42:14,090
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1558
01:42:14,466 --> 01:42:15,634
Bring it up.

1559
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,761
<i>That's the thing, sir, we can't.</i>

1560
01:42:18,887 --> 01:42:21,514
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1561
01:42:21,681 --> 01:42:23,058
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1562
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:24,684
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

1563
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:27,646
<i>and to be honest, some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

1564
01:42:27,812 --> 01:42:29,522
They didn't open it, did they?

1565
01:42:29,689 --> 01:42:31,858
<i>Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1566
01:42:32,692 --> 01:42:34,611
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1567
01:43:01,805 --> 01:43:05,308
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1568
01:43:06,059 --> 01:43:07,519
My wife's expecting.

1569
01:43:07,686 --> 01:43:10,522
And too much time at the office.

1570
01:43:12,357 --> 01:43:13,733
Congratulations.

1571
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:16,027
-Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
-Yeah, sure.

1572
01:43:17,112 --> 01:43:19,197
-How far along is she?
-I don't know.

1573
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:23,743
She's at the point where
she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1574
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:27,372
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1575
01:43:28,290 --> 01:43:29,291
I have a little girl.

1576
01:43:29,457 --> 01:43:30,959
A girl would be nice.

1577
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:33,128
Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1578
01:43:33,795 --> 01:43:35,255
What'd be so awful about that?

1579
01:43:35,422 --> 01:43:40,802
Let's just say that the greater good
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1580
01:43:44,848 --> 01:43:45,890
And you've never seen these two men before?

1581
01:43:46,057 --> 01:43:47,892
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1582
01:43:48,059 --> 01:43:50,312
-Can you describe them?
-One of them had a hippie beard.

1583
01:43:50,478 --> 01:43:52,647
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1584
01:43:52,814 --> 01:43:53,857
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1585
01:43:54,024 --> 01:43:56,192
Yeah, this is Chesler.
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1586
01:43:56,359 --> 01:43:58,236
We have a potential breach.

1587
01:44:16,129 --> 01:44:17,088
I said bring them in.

1588
01:44:17,255 --> 01:44:19,424
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit
has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1589
01:44:19,591 --> 01:44:20,425
Oh, for the love of...

1590
01:44:20,592 --> 01:44:22,093
I'll look at the weather projections.

1591
01:44:46,117 --> 01:44:48,119
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1592
01:44:59,464 --> 01:45:01,174
So, where you at with names?

1593
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:04,469
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1594
01:45:05,428 --> 01:45:07,722
Might wanna let that stew awhile.
You got time.

1595
01:45:09,516 --> 01:45:11,017
Let me ask you a question.

1596
01:45:12,018 --> 01:45:15,271
When your kid was born, were you nervous?

1597
01:45:15,438 --> 01:45:16,773
Wildly.

1598
01:45:17,023 --> 01:45:18,733
-Yeah.
-Did you feel qualified?

1599
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:22,487
Like you had any idea
how to successfully operate that thing?

1600
01:45:22,904 --> 01:45:25,740
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1601
01:45:25,907 --> 01:45:27,909
I thought about what my dad did.

1602
01:45:28,618 --> 01:45:30,787
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1603
01:45:31,579 --> 01:45:33,623
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1604
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:36,501
And now, looking back on it,
I just remember the good stuff.

1605
01:45:36,668 --> 01:45:38,253
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1606
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,796
Yeah? Like what?

1607
01:45:40,922 --> 01:45:43,425
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1608
01:45:44,759 --> 01:45:45,802
Smart guy.

1609
01:45:46,219 --> 01:45:47,679
He did his best.

1610
01:45:49,055 --> 01:45:53,018
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1611
01:46:01,776 --> 01:46:03,153
Good to meet you, Potts.

1612
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:04,654
Yeah.

1613
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:06,239
Howard...

1614
01:46:06,823 --> 01:46:08,408
everything's gonna be all right.

1615
01:46:11,411 --> 01:46:12,662
Thank you...

1616
01:46:13,621 --> 01:46:14,956
for everything...

1617
01:46:15,373 --> 01:46:17,667
you've done for this country.

1618
01:46:20,545 --> 01:46:21,671
Jarvis.

1619
01:46:25,383 --> 01:46:26,926
Have we ever met that guy?

1620
01:46:28,928 --> 01:46:30,430
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1621
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:34,684
Seems very familiar.

1622
01:46:35,602 --> 01:46:37,062
Weird beard.

1623
01:46:45,403 --> 01:46:46,404
You're weak.

1624
01:46:46,946 --> 01:46:48,031
I'm you.

1625
01:47:05,674 --> 01:47:07,759
You could stop this.

1626
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:09,844
You know you want to.

1627
01:47:10,553 --> 01:47:12,722
Did you see what happens in the future?

1628
01:47:14,015 --> 01:47:16,393
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1629
01:47:17,936 --> 01:47:19,938
You wanna know how he does that?

1630
01:47:21,314 --> 01:47:25,485
You wanna know what he does to you?

1631
01:47:25,986 --> 01:47:26,987
That's enough.

1632
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,251
You disgust me.

1633
01:47:42,544 --> 01:47:47,424
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1634
01:48:09,112 --> 01:48:10,822
How do I look?

1635
01:48:17,412 --> 01:48:18,413
Wow.

1636
01:48:19,414 --> 01:48:22,542
Under different circumstances...

1637
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:24,711
this would be totally awesome.

1638
01:48:36,848 --> 01:48:39,684
I bet the raccoon
didn't have to climb a mountain.

1639
01:48:39,851 --> 01:48:41,770
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1640
01:48:41,936 --> 01:48:43,480
Whatever.
He eats garbage.

1641
01:48:43,647 --> 01:48:44,981
Welcome.

1642
01:48:48,151 --> 01:48:49,486
Natasha.

1643
01:48:49,653 --> 01:48:50,654
Daughter of Ivan.

1644
01:48:51,988 --> 01:48:53,114
Clint.

1645
01:48:53,281 --> 01:48:55,575
Son of Edith.

1646
01:49:00,955 --> 01:49:02,415
Who are you?

1647
01:49:03,041 --> 01:49:05,502
Consider me a guide...

1648
01:49:05,669 --> 01:49:07,337
to you...

1649
01:49:07,504 --> 01:49:09,339
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1650
01:49:09,506 --> 01:49:10,548
Oh, good.

1651
01:49:10,715 --> 01:49:12,842
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1652
01:49:16,763 --> 01:49:19,015
If only it were that easy.

1653
01:49:31,111 --> 01:49:34,823
What you seek lies in front of you.

1654
01:49:36,074 --> 01:49:38,493
As does what you fear.

1655
01:49:43,415 --> 01:49:45,291
The stone's down there.

1656
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:47,836
For one of you.

1657
01:49:48,128 --> 01:49:49,838
For the other...

1658
01:49:52,507 --> 01:49:54,426
In order to take the stone...

1659
01:49:54,592 --> 01:49:57,595
you must lose that which you love.

1660
01:49:58,972 --> 01:50:02,142
An everlasting exchange.

1661
01:50:03,143 --> 01:50:07,230
A soul for a soul.

1662
01:50:09,816 --> 01:50:11,192
How's it going?

1663
01:50:14,612 --> 01:50:16,031
Jesus.

1664
01:50:16,364 --> 01:50:18,074
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1665
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:20,285
No.

1666
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,120
I don't think so.

1667
01:50:22,829 --> 01:50:24,998
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1668
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:27,542
I didn't.

1669
01:50:29,044 --> 01:50:31,421
Thanos left here with the stone...

1670
01:50:32,088 --> 01:50:33,631
without his daughter.

1671
01:50:33,798 --> 01:50:35,884
That's not a coincidence.

1672
01:50:36,968 --> 01:50:38,595
Yeah.

1673
01:50:40,305 --> 01:50:42,182
Whatever it takes.

1674
01:50:46,686 --> 01:50:48,188
Whatever it takes.

1675
01:50:52,567 --> 01:50:54,527
If we don't get that stone...

1676
01:50:54,694 --> 01:50:56,363
billions of people stay dead.

1677
01:50:57,238 --> 01:50:58,406
Yeah.

1678
01:51:00,283 --> 01:51:02,410
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1679
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:04,329
I guess we do.

1680
01:51:12,754 --> 01:51:17,467
I'm starting to think
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1681
01:51:17,968 --> 01:51:19,803
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1682
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:21,221
Get to right here.

1683
01:51:21,388 --> 01:51:23,390
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1684
01:51:23,556 --> 01:51:25,767
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1685
01:51:25,934 --> 01:51:27,936
What, you think I wanna do it?

1686
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,271
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1687
01:51:30,438 --> 01:51:32,774
Yeah, well, I don't want you to.
How's that?

1688
01:51:33,692 --> 01:51:35,902
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1689
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:39,364
You know what I've become.

1690
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:44,077
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1691
01:51:48,248 --> 01:51:49,499
Maybe you should.

1692
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:51,918
You didn't.

1693
01:51:58,091 --> 01:52:00,302
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1694
01:52:11,396 --> 01:52:12,605
Okay.

1695
01:52:14,357 --> 01:52:15,859
You win.

1696
01:52:22,324 --> 01:52:23,491
Tell my family I love 'em.

1697
01:52:27,203 --> 01:52:28,413
You tell 'em yourself.

1698
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:02,280
Damn you.

1699
01:53:09,788 --> 01:53:10,789
Wait.

1700
01:53:18,838 --> 01:53:20,674
Let me go.

1701
01:53:21,925 --> 01:53:22,926
No.

1702
01:53:24,678 --> 01:53:25,679
No. Please, no.

1703
01:53:29,057 --> 01:53:30,892
It's okay.

1704
01:53:33,103 --> 01:53:33,937
Please.

1705
01:53:36,022 --> 01:53:37,023
No!

1706
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,501
Did we get 'em all?

1707
01:55:20,919 --> 01:55:22,712
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1708
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:28,760
Clint, where's Nat?

1709
01:55:57,998 --> 01:55:58,999
Do we know if she had family?

1710
01:56:00,166 --> 01:56:01,334
Yeah.

1711
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:02,502
Us.

1712
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:04,963
What?

1713
01:56:06,923 --> 01:56:08,091
-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

1714
01:56:08,258 --> 01:56:09,509
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1715
01:56:09,676 --> 01:56:12,137
Why are we acting like she's dead?
We have the stones, right?

1716
01:56:12,304 --> 01:56:13,305
As long as we have the stones...

1717
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:15,223
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1718
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:17,392
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1719
01:56:17,559 --> 01:56:18,768
Can't get her back.

1720
01:56:21,771 --> 01:56:23,023
What's he...?
What?

1721
01:56:23,189 --> 01:56:24,399
It can't be undone.

1722
01:56:24,983 --> 01:56:26,693
It can't.

1723
01:56:29,195 --> 01:56:32,324
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,
but you're a very earthly being, okay?

1724
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:33,783
And we're talking about space magic.

1725
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:35,952
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1726
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:38,955
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside
my pay grade here.

1727
01:56:39,122 --> 01:56:40,582
But she still isn't here, is she?

1728
01:56:40,749 --> 01:56:41,750
No, that's my point.

1729
01:56:41,916 --> 01:56:44,878
It can't be undone.

1730
01:56:45,045 --> 01:56:48,381
Or that's at least
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1731
01:56:48,548 --> 01:56:50,008
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1732
01:56:50,175 --> 01:56:53,219
Go grab your hammer
and you go fly and you talk to him.

1733
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:03,813
It was supposed to be me.

1734
01:57:06,066 --> 01:57:08,360
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1735
01:57:08,526 --> 01:57:09,986
She bet her life on it.

1736
01:57:14,908 --> 01:57:17,243
She's not coming back.

1737
01:57:19,037 --> 01:57:20,580
We have to make it worth it.

1738
01:57:21,081 --> 01:57:22,540
We have to.

1739
01:57:23,959 --> 01:57:25,627
We will.

1740
01:57:50,318 --> 01:57:51,444
Boom!

1741
01:57:57,117 --> 01:57:58,576
All right, the glove's ready.

1742
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:01,955
Question is,
who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1743
01:58:02,122 --> 01:58:04,207
-I'll do it.
-Excuse me?

1744
01:58:04,374 --> 01:58:05,333
It's okay.

1745
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,418
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1746
01:58:06,584 --> 01:58:08,086
Thor. Just wait.

1747
01:58:08,253 --> 01:58:10,088
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1748
01:58:10,463 --> 01:58:13,383
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1749
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:14,676
We should at least discuss it.

1750
01:58:14,843 --> 01:58:18,680
Look, sitting here staring at the thing
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1751
01:58:19,723 --> 01:58:22,642
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1752
01:58:22,809 --> 01:58:24,019
-Normally, you're right.
-It's my duty.

1753
01:58:24,185 --> 01:58:25,979
-It's not about that.
-It's not that.

1754
01:58:26,146 --> 01:58:27,939
-Hey, buddy...
-Stop it! Just let me.

1755
01:58:30,942 --> 01:58:32,444
Just let me do it.

1756
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:35,113
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1757
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,281
Look, it's not just the fact...

1758
01:58:36,448 --> 01:58:38,575
that that glove is channeling enough energy
to light up a continent.

1759
01:58:38,742 --> 01:58:40,744
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1760
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:43,955
What do you think
is coursing through my veins right now?

1761
01:58:44,122 --> 01:58:45,165
Cheez Whiz?

1762
01:58:47,709 --> 01:58:48,710
Lightning.

1763
01:58:48,877 --> 01:58:50,003
-Yeah.
-Lightning.

1764
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:51,546
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1765
01:58:51,713 --> 01:58:53,548
It's gotta be me.

1766
01:58:54,883 --> 01:58:57,052
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1767
01:58:57,218 --> 01:58:58,762
They almost killed him.

1768
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,057
None of you could survive.

1769
01:59:02,766 --> 01:59:04,392
How do we know you will?

1770
01:59:04,559 --> 01:59:05,602
We don't.

1771
01:59:05,894 --> 01:59:08,438
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1772
01:59:11,941 --> 01:59:13,526
It's like...

1773
01:59:15,403 --> 01:59:17,322
I was made for this.

1774
01:59:36,257 --> 01:59:37,759
Good to go, yeah?

1775
01:59:39,886 --> 01:59:40,887
Let's do it.

1776
01:59:41,054 --> 01:59:44,099
Okay, remember, everyone
Thanos snapped away five years ago...

1777
01:59:44,265 --> 01:59:46,726
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1778
01:59:46,893 --> 01:59:48,311
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1779
01:59:49,729 --> 01:59:50,897
Got it.

1780
02:00:07,288 --> 02:00:10,083
<i>Friday, do me a favor
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?</i>

1781
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:11,543
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1782
02:00:20,135 --> 02:00:21,970
Everybody comes home.

1783
02:00:45,368 --> 02:00:46,786
Take it off! Take it off!

1784
02:00:46,953 --> 02:00:48,079
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1785
02:00:49,247 --> 02:00:50,457
<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>

1786
02:00:53,627 --> 02:00:54,628
I'm okay.

1787
02:00:55,128 --> 02:00:56,421
I'm okay.

1788
02:01:27,869 --> 02:01:28,995
Bruce!

1789
02:01:30,747 --> 02:01:32,332
Don't move him.

1790
02:01:39,214 --> 02:01:41,216
-Did it work?
-We're not sure. It's okay.

1791
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:28,596
Honey.

1792
02:02:28,763 --> 02:02:29,723
<i>Clint?</i>

1793
02:02:29,889 --> 02:02:31,141
Honey.

1794
02:02:31,975 --> 02:02:33,310
Guys...

1795
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:37,147
I think it worked.

1796
02:03:19,773 --> 02:03:21,650
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

1797
02:03:22,901 --> 02:03:24,694
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1798
02:03:31,326 --> 02:03:33,119
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1799
02:03:34,287 --> 02:03:35,830
Let me up! Let me up!

1800
02:03:36,581 --> 02:03:37,332
Come on!

1801
02:03:47,467 --> 02:03:48,301
Rhodey!

1802
02:03:56,851 --> 02:03:59,896
<i>Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy?
We're on the lower level. It's flooding!</i>

1803
02:04:00,063 --> 02:04:01,773
What? What?

1804
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:04,109
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1805
02:04:04,275 --> 02:04:06,444
Wait! I'm here!

1806
02:04:06,611 --> 02:04:08,113
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1807
02:04:27,757 --> 02:04:28,967
Cap?

1808
02:04:52,949 --> 02:04:54,075
Okay.

1809
02:05:13,345 --> 02:05:14,471
Daughter.

1810
02:05:14,638 --> 02:05:15,805
Yes, Father.

1811
02:05:17,682 --> 02:05:19,392
So, this is the future.

1812
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:20,894
Well done.

1813
02:05:21,811 --> 02:05:23,313
Thank you, Father.

1814
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:24,856
They suspected nothing.

1815
02:05:27,192 --> 02:05:28,652
The arrogant never do.

1816
02:05:31,613 --> 02:05:32,739
Go.

1817
02:05:33,698 --> 02:05:36,117
Find the stones, bring them to me.

1818
02:05:36,284 --> 02:05:37,994
What will you do?

1819
02:05:39,329 --> 02:05:40,997
Wait.

1820
02:06:06,231 --> 02:06:07,899
Tell me something.

1821
02:06:09,025 --> 02:06:11,444
In the future...

1822
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:13,488
what happens to you and me?

1823
02:06:15,782 --> 02:06:17,409
I try to kill you.

1824
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:20,620
Several times.

1825
02:06:21,705 --> 02:06:23,665
But eventually...

1826
02:06:23,832 --> 02:06:25,792
we become friends.

1827
02:06:27,294 --> 02:06:29,004
We become sisters.

1828
02:06:36,678 --> 02:06:37,887
Come on.

1829
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:41,725
We can stop him.

1830
02:06:49,816 --> 02:06:51,151
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1831
02:06:51,693 --> 02:06:53,153
That's my man.

1832
02:06:54,070 --> 02:06:56,114
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1833
02:06:59,659 --> 02:07:00,827
What happened?

1834
02:07:00,994 --> 02:07:03,121
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1835
02:07:03,288 --> 02:07:04,164
You'll see.

1836
02:07:26,269 --> 02:07:27,646
What's he been doing?

1837
02:07:29,564 --> 02:07:30,982
Absolutely nothing.

1838
02:07:32,734 --> 02:07:34,611
Where are the stones?

1839
02:07:34,986 --> 02:07:36,821
Somewhere under all this.

1840
02:07:38,198 --> 02:07:40,408
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

1841
02:07:40,575 --> 02:07:42,327
So, we keep it that way.

1842
02:07:42,494 --> 02:07:43,870
You know it's a trap, right?

1843
02:07:44,037 --> 02:07:45,372
Yeah.

1844
02:07:45,538 --> 02:07:46,873
I don't much care.

1845
02:07:47,624 --> 02:07:48,625
Good.

1846
02:07:49,584 --> 02:07:52,087
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

1847
02:08:01,846 --> 02:08:03,848
Let's kill him properly this time.

1848
02:08:13,233 --> 02:08:16,152
You could not live with your own failure.

1849
02:08:17,654 --> 02:08:19,489
Where did that bring you?

1850
02:08:22,450 --> 02:08:24,327
Back to me.

1851
02:08:27,747 --> 02:08:30,583
I thought by eliminating half of life...

1852
02:08:31,334 --> 02:08:33,712
the other half would thrive.

1853
02:08:33,878 --> 02:08:35,213
But you've shown me...

1854
02:08:36,381 --> 02:08:38,133
that's impossible.

1855
02:08:40,051 --> 02:08:43,346
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

1856
02:08:43,513 --> 02:08:48,727
there will always be those
that are unable to accept what can be.

1857
02:08:49,477 --> 02:08:50,729
They will resist.

1858
02:08:51,229 --> 02:08:53,148
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

1859
02:08:54,065 --> 02:08:55,650
I'm thankful.

1860
02:08:57,819 --> 02:08:59,571
Because now...

1861
02:08:59,738 --> 02:09:01,865
I know what I must do.

1862
02:09:02,324 --> 02:09:05,285
I will shred this universe...

1863
02:09:05,452 --> 02:09:07,495
down to its last atom.

1864
02:09:08,288 --> 02:09:09,956
And then...

1865
02:09:10,123 --> 02:09:12,459
with the stones you've collected for me...

1866
02:09:13,251 --> 02:09:15,378
create a new one...

1867
02:09:15,545 --> 02:09:17,756
teeming with life...

1868
02:09:17,922 --> 02:09:19,799
that knows not what it has lost...

1869
02:09:19,966 --> 02:09:22,344
but only what it has been given.

1870
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:26,848
A grateful universe.

1871
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:28,808
Born out of blood.

1872
02:09:28,975 --> 02:09:30,644
They'll never know it.

1873
02:09:31,853 --> 02:09:34,773
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

1874
02:09:49,371 --> 02:09:50,664
See you on the other side, man.

1875
02:09:52,999 --> 02:09:55,001
Hang on! I'm coming!

1876
02:10:25,281 --> 02:10:26,282
Yeah!

1877
02:10:41,172 --> 02:10:42,716
Oh, hey.

1878
02:10:42,882 --> 02:10:44,592
I know you.

1879
02:10:47,512 --> 02:10:48,513
Father...

1880
02:10:49,264 --> 02:10:50,682
I have the stones.

1881
02:10:50,849 --> 02:10:51,766
What?

1882
02:10:53,143 --> 02:10:54,060
Stop.

1883
02:10:59,274 --> 02:11:00,692
You're betraying us?

1884
02:11:06,698 --> 02:11:07,991
You don't have to do this.

1885
02:11:10,827 --> 02:11:13,330
I am this.

1886
02:11:13,496 --> 02:11:15,415
No, you're not.

1887
02:11:15,874 --> 02:11:17,751
You've seen what we become.

1888
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:26,051
Nebula, listen to her.

1889
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:28,386
You can change.

1890
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:36,561
He won't let me.

1891
02:11:38,188 --> 02:11:38,938
No!

1892
02:11:58,583 --> 02:11:59,959
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1893
02:12:16,601 --> 02:12:17,894
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

1894
02:13:09,195 --> 02:13:10,488
I knew it!

1895
02:14:32,862 --> 02:14:35,699
In all my years of conquest...

1896
02:14:36,992 --> 02:14:38,743
violence...

1897
02:14:39,786 --> 02:14:41,746
slaughter...

1898
02:14:42,872 --> 02:14:45,291
it was never personal.

1899
02:14:47,877 --> 02:14:49,963
But I'll tell you now...

1900
02:14:51,965 --> 02:14:58,221
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn, annoying little planet...

1901
02:14:59,973 --> 02:15:02,183
I'm gonna enjoy it...

1902
02:15:03,101 --> 02:15:05,687
very, very much.

1903
02:16:08,959 --> 02:16:10,502
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

1904
02:16:16,508 --> 02:16:18,802
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

1905
02:16:22,806 --> 02:16:24,224
<i>On your left.</i>

1906
02:17:49,893 --> 02:17:51,186
Is that everyone?

1907
02:17:51,353 --> 02:17:53,563
What? You wanted more?

1908
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:22,050
Avengers...

1909
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:28,264
assemble.

1910
02:19:03,466 --> 02:19:04,718
Die!

1911
02:19:25,363 --> 02:19:28,116
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

1912
02:19:41,796 --> 02:19:42,631
Hey!

1913
02:19:43,632 --> 02:19:44,633
Holy cow!

1914
02:19:44,799 --> 02:19:46,176
You will not believe what's been going on.

1915
02:19:46,259 --> 02:19:47,469
Do you remember when we were in space?

1916
02:19:47,636 --> 02:19:49,012
And I got all dusty?

1917
02:19:49,179 --> 02:19:51,848
And I must've passed out,
because I woke up and you were gone.

1918
02:19:52,015 --> 02:19:53,642
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
And he was like...

1919
02:19:53,808 --> 02:19:55,310
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

1920
02:19:55,477 --> 02:19:57,145
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time.

1921
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,146
He did? Oh, no.

1922
02:19:58,313 --> 02:19:59,606
What are you doing?

1923
02:20:04,653 --> 02:20:06,154
This is nice.

1924
02:20:27,926 --> 02:20:28,927
Gamora?

1925
02:20:38,353 --> 02:20:40,021
I thought I lost you.

1926
02:20:44,609 --> 02:20:47,529
Don't touch me!

1927
02:20:50,532 --> 02:20:52,367
You missed the first time.

1928
02:20:52,534 --> 02:20:54,536
Then you got 'em both the second time.

1929
02:20:56,538 --> 02:20:57,622
This is the one?

1930
02:20:57,789 --> 02:20:58,790
Seriously?

1931
02:20:58,957 --> 02:21:00,959
Your choices were him or a tree.

1932
02:21:11,761 --> 02:21:12,762
Cap!

1933
02:21:12,929 --> 02:21:14,681
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

1934
02:21:17,392 --> 02:21:19,436
Get those stones as far away as possible!

1935
02:21:19,602 --> 02:21:20,645
No!

1936
02:21:21,813 --> 02:21:23,773
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

1937
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:26,526
No way to get 'em back.
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1938
02:21:26,693 --> 02:21:27,527
Hold on!

1939
02:21:29,404 --> 02:21:31,531
That wasn't our only time machine.

1940
02:21:37,537 --> 02:21:39,456
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

1941
02:21:39,998 --> 02:21:43,084
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

1942
02:21:43,251 --> 02:21:45,378
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1943
02:21:46,755 --> 02:21:47,756
Maybe 10 minutes.

1944
02:21:47,922 --> 02:21:49,424
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

1945
02:21:49,591 --> 02:21:51,134
We're on it, Cap.

1946
02:22:00,894 --> 02:22:02,020
Hey.

1947
02:22:02,187 --> 02:22:05,190
You said one out of 14 million,
we win, yeah?

1948
02:22:06,107 --> 02:22:07,108
Tell me this is it.

1949
02:22:07,525 --> 02:22:09,402
If I tell you what happens...

1950
02:22:09,569 --> 02:22:10,737
it won't happen.

1951
02:22:14,324 --> 02:22:15,325
You better be right.

1952
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:25,126
It's a mess back here.

1953
02:22:26,127 --> 02:22:27,128
It's dead.

1954
02:22:28,421 --> 02:22:29,923
-What?
-It's dead.

1955
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,508
I have to hot-wire it.

1956
02:22:34,594 --> 02:22:35,804
Where's Nebula?

1957
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,264
She's not responding.

1958
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:39,975
Sire...

1959
02:22:49,734 --> 02:22:50,986
Clint!

1960
02:22:53,029 --> 02:22:54,155
Give it to me.

1961
02:23:16,428 --> 02:23:19,806
You took everything from me.

1962
02:23:20,181 --> 02:23:22,517
I don't even know who you are.

1963
02:23:22,684 --> 02:23:24,311
You will.

1964
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:47,709
I got it!

1965
02:23:50,253 --> 02:23:51,338
Activate Instant Kill.

1966
02:24:14,778 --> 02:24:16,112
Rain fire!

1967
02:24:16,821 --> 02:24:18,740
But, sire, our troops!

1968
02:24:18,907 --> 02:24:20,659
Just do it!

1969
02:24:40,804 --> 02:24:43,181
<i>Is anyone else seeing this?</i>

1970
02:24:57,112 --> 02:24:58,238
I got this!

1971
02:24:58,488 --> 02:25:00,281
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

1972
02:25:00,615 --> 02:25:01,783
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

1973
02:25:01,950 --> 02:25:03,827
Hey, Queens, heads up!

1974
02:25:13,878 --> 02:25:14,921
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1975
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:19,718
Hey! Nice to meet you...

1976
02:25:19,884 --> 02:25:21,720
Oh, my God!

1977
02:25:57,964 --> 02:25:59,424
What the hell is this?

1978
02:26:00,216 --> 02:26:01,301
Friday, what are they firing at?

1979
02:26:01,468 --> 02:26:03,345
<i>Something just entered the upper atmosphere.</i>

1980
02:26:16,608 --> 02:26:18,777
Oh, yeah!

1981
02:26:38,672 --> 02:26:41,091
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1982
02:26:49,849 --> 02:26:52,435
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

1983
02:26:53,061 --> 02:26:54,479
Hey, Peter Parker.

1984
02:26:54,646 --> 02:26:55,814
You got something for me?

1985
02:27:01,945 --> 02:27:04,030
I don't know how you're gonna get it
through all of that.

1986
02:27:05,699 --> 02:27:07,117
Don't worry.

1987
02:27:07,993 --> 02:27:09,577
She's got help.

1988
02:29:57,412 --> 02:30:00,915
I am inevitable.

1989
02:30:21,019 --> 02:30:22,562
And I...

1990
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:25,398
am...

1991
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:30,612
Iron Man.

1992
02:32:29,314 --> 02:32:31,024
Mr. Stark?

1993
02:32:31,441 --> 02:32:32,692
Hey!

1994
02:32:33,693 --> 02:32:36,655
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

1995
02:32:36,821 --> 02:32:38,365
It's Peter.

1996
02:32:39,658 --> 02:32:41,284
Hey.

1997
02:32:42,327 --> 02:32:45,372
We won, Mr. Stark.

1998
02:32:47,207 --> 02:32:49,376
We won, Mr. Stark.

1999
02:32:51,002 --> 02:32:53,838
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

2000
02:32:54,756 --> 02:32:56,049
I'm sorry.

2001
02:32:56,216 --> 02:32:57,217
Tony.

2002
02:33:10,897 --> 02:33:11,940
Hey.

2003
02:33:12,107 --> 02:33:13,942
Hey, Pep.

2004
02:33:18,238 --> 02:33:19,322
Friday?

2005
02:33:19,489 --> 02:33:22,242
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2006
02:33:30,834 --> 02:33:31,835
Tony?

2007
02:33:33,086 --> 02:33:34,170
Look at me.

2008
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:38,758
We're gonna be okay.

2009
02:33:43,471 --> 02:33:45,348
You can rest now.

2010
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:33,665
<i>Everybody wants a happy ending, right?</i>

2011
02:35:33,832 --> 02:35:36,042
<i>But it doesn't always roll that way.</i>

2012
02:35:38,128 --> 02:35:39,796
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

2013
02:35:41,381 --> 02:35:44,050
<i>I'm hoping if you play this back...</i>

2014
02:35:45,719 --> 02:35:47,053
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

2015
02:35:48,305 --> 02:35:51,975
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

2016
02:35:52,142 --> 02:35:56,062
<i>And something like a normal version
of the planet has been restored.</i>

2017
02:35:56,229 --> 02:35:58,189
<i>If there ever was such a thing.</i>

2018
02:35:58,773 --> 02:36:01,776
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

2019
02:36:02,736 --> 02:36:04,738
<i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...</i>

2020
02:36:04,904 --> 02:36:08,575
<i>let alone to this extent, I mean,
I wouldn't have been surprised...</i>

2021
02:36:08,742 --> 02:36:10,368
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

2022
02:36:10,535 --> 02:36:15,165
<i>The epic forces of darkness and light
that have come into play.</i>

2023
02:36:15,332 --> 02:36:17,042
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

2024
02:36:17,208 --> 02:36:21,379
<i>that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.</i>

2025
02:36:24,633 --> 02:36:26,426
<i>So, I thought I'd probably
better record a little greeting...</i>

2026
02:36:26,593 --> 02:36:30,221
<i>in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.</i>

2027
02:36:30,388 --> 02:36:33,642
<i>Not that death at any time isn't untimely.</i>

2028
02:36:34,851 --> 02:36:37,896
<i>This time travel thing
that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

2029
02:36:38,063 --> 02:36:40,273
<i>it's got me scratching my head
about the survivability of it all.</i>

2030
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:41,900
<i>That's the thing.</i>

2031
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:45,779
<i>Then again, that's the hero gig, right?</i>

2032
02:36:45,945 --> 02:36:47,030
<i>Part of the journey is the end.</i>

2033
02:36:49,032 --> 02:36:50,033
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

2034
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:54,287
<i>Everything is gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.</i>

2035
02:36:57,791 --> 02:36:59,459
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

2036
02:39:14,386 --> 02:39:18,139
You know, I wish there was a way
that I could let her know.

2037
02:39:20,642 --> 02:39:22,769
That we won.

2038
02:39:24,145 --> 02:39:25,855
We did it.

2039
02:39:29,442 --> 02:39:31,236
She knows.

2040
02:39:36,116 --> 02:39:38,201
They both do.

2041
02:39:47,168 --> 02:39:48,253
<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>

2042
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:49,421
Good.

2043
02:39:49,587 --> 02:39:50,922
-You good?
-Mm-hmm.

2044
02:39:51,089 --> 02:39:53,800
-Good. You hungry?
-Mm-hmm.

2045
02:39:54,217 --> 02:39:55,218
What do you want?

2046
02:39:55,927 --> 02:39:57,345
Cheeseburgers.

2047
02:40:02,142 --> 02:40:04,394
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2048
02:40:04,561 --> 02:40:05,979
Okay.

2049
02:40:08,565 --> 02:40:10,817
I'm gonna get you
all the cheeseburgers you want.

2050
02:40:10,984 --> 02:40:11,985
Okay.

2051
02:40:28,752 --> 02:40:30,170
So...

2052
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:32,589
when can we expect you back?

2053
02:40:34,674 --> 02:40:36,009
About that...

2054
02:40:36,259 --> 02:40:38,428
Thor, your people need a king.

2055
02:40:38,595 --> 02:40:40,472
No, they already have one.

2056
02:40:42,599 --> 02:40:43,600
That's funny.

2057
02:40:49,189 --> 02:40:51,024
Are you being serious?

2058
02:40:54,694 --> 02:40:56,946
It's time for me to be who I am...

2059
02:40:57,530 --> 02:41:00,116
rather than who I'm supposed to be.

2060
02:41:01,409 --> 02:41:03,161
But you, you're a leader.

2061
02:41:03,787 --> 02:41:05,497
That's who you are.

2062
02:41:07,999 --> 02:41:09,959
You know, I'd make a lot of changes
around here.

2063
02:41:10,126 --> 02:41:11,628
I'm counting on it...

2064
02:41:11,795 --> 02:41:13,296
Your Majesty.

2065
02:41:23,431 --> 02:41:24,641
What will you do?

2066
02:41:25,392 --> 02:41:26,810
I'm not sure.

2067
02:41:26,977 --> 02:41:30,522
For the first time in a thousand years,
I have no path.

2068
02:41:30,689 --> 02:41:32,107
I do have a ride though.

2069
02:41:32,273 --> 02:41:34,234
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2070
02:41:38,738 --> 02:41:40,281
Here we are!

2071
02:41:40,740 --> 02:41:42,283
Tree, good to see you.

2072
02:41:46,871 --> 02:41:50,166
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2073
02:41:50,583 --> 02:41:52,460
Where to first?

2074
02:41:53,586 --> 02:41:54,629
Hey.

2075
02:41:55,255 --> 02:41:57,215
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2076
02:41:57,382 --> 02:41:58,383
I'm in charge.

2077
02:41:58,925 --> 02:42:01,469
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2078
02:42:01,636 --> 02:42:03,179
Of course.

2079
02:42:05,807 --> 02:42:08,351
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2080
02:42:08,518 --> 02:42:11,021
It makes you think that maybe
you didn't realize I was in charge.

2081
02:42:11,646 --> 02:42:12,981
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2082
02:42:13,148 --> 02:42:14,149
Quail?

2083
02:42:14,316 --> 02:42:16,568
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service
and assisting.

2084
02:42:16,735 --> 02:42:17,944
Quill.

2085
02:42:18,111 --> 02:42:18,987
That's what I said.

2086
02:42:19,154 --> 02:42:21,531
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2087
02:42:21,698 --> 02:42:23,074
Sounds fair.

2088
02:42:25,827 --> 02:42:28,204
-It's not necessary, okay?
-It's not.

2089
02:42:28,371 --> 02:42:30,749
I got some blasters,
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2090
02:42:30,915 --> 02:42:33,126
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2091
02:42:33,293 --> 02:42:34,377
Yeah. Knives.

2092
02:42:34,544 --> 02:42:36,087
I am Groot.

2093
02:42:41,843 --> 02:42:43,219
Not necessary.

2094
02:42:43,386 --> 02:42:44,846
There shall be no knifing one another.

2095
02:42:45,013 --> 02:42:48,016
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2096
02:42:51,603 --> 02:42:52,812
Me.

2097
02:42:53,897 --> 02:42:54,731
Right?

2098
02:42:55,649 --> 02:42:57,859
Yes, you.

2099
02:42:58,109 --> 02:43:00,528
Of course! Of course.

2100
02:43:00,695 --> 02:43:02,364
Of course.

2101
02:43:04,115 --> 02:43:05,659
Remember...

2102
02:43:06,493 --> 02:43:08,787
you have to return the stones
to the exact moment you got 'em...

2103
02:43:08,953 --> 02:43:12,165
or you're gonna open up
a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2104
02:43:12,332 --> 02:43:13,333
Don't worry, Bruce.

2105
02:43:13,875 --> 02:43:15,752
Clip all the branches.

2106
02:43:16,294 --> 02:43:18,046
You know, I tried.

2107
02:43:19,339 --> 02:43:23,551
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

2108
02:43:26,846 --> 02:43:28,473
I miss her, man.

2109
02:43:28,848 --> 02:43:29,849
Me too.

2110
02:43:33,937 --> 02:43:36,356
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2111
02:43:38,942 --> 02:43:40,402
You're a good man, Sam.

2112
02:43:40,944 --> 02:43:42,487
This one's on me, though.

2113
02:43:46,950 --> 02:43:48,868
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2114
02:43:50,704 --> 02:43:51,955
How can I?

2115
02:43:52,122 --> 02:43:53,915
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2116
02:44:01,506 --> 02:44:03,300
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2117
02:44:03,675 --> 02:44:05,176
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2118
02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:14,352
How long is this gonna take?

2119
02:44:14,602 --> 02:44:17,355
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2120
02:44:22,444 --> 02:44:23,695
You ready, Cap?

2121
02:44:23,862 --> 02:44:26,281
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2122
02:44:26,948 --> 02:44:28,074
You bet.

2123
02:44:29,576 --> 02:44:31,161
Going quantum.
Three...

2124
02:44:31,745 --> 02:44:32,579
two...

2125
02:44:33,246 --> 02:44:34,456
one.

2126
02:44:36,333 --> 02:44:38,376
And returning in five...

2127
02:44:38,543 --> 02:44:39,502
four...

2128
02:44:39,669 --> 02:44:41,504
three, two...

2129
02:44:41,671 --> 02:44:43,006
one.

2130
02:44:50,263 --> 02:44:51,264
Where is he?

2131
02:44:51,431 --> 02:44:53,183
I don't know.
He blew right by his time stamp.

2132
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:54,809
He should be here.

2133
02:45:00,315 --> 02:45:01,232
Get him back.

2134
02:45:01,399 --> 02:45:02,525
-I'm trying.
-Get him the hell back.

2135
02:45:02,692 --> 02:45:04,569
-Hey, I said I'm trying.
-Sam.

2136
02:45:28,551 --> 02:45:30,136
Go ahead.

2137
02:45:48,113 --> 02:45:48,863
Cap?

2138
02:45:51,199 --> 02:45:52,951
Hi, Sam.

2139
02:45:55,954 --> 02:45:58,999
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2140
02:46:01,126 --> 02:46:04,963
Well, after I put the stones back,
I thought...

2141
02:46:06,089 --> 02:46:07,424
maybe...

2142
02:46:07,924 --> 02:46:12,721
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2143
02:46:14,723 --> 02:46:16,850
How'd that work out for ya?

2144
02:46:19,352 --> 02:46:20,770
It was beautiful.

2145
02:46:22,105 --> 02:46:23,815
Good. I'm happy for you.

2146
02:46:23,982 --> 02:46:25,025
Truly.

2147
02:46:25,775 --> 02:46:27,068
Thank you.

2148
02:46:28,403 --> 02:46:29,654
Only thing bumming me out...

2149
02:46:29,821 --> 02:46:33,408
is the fact I have to live in a world
without Captain America.

2150
02:46:37,203 --> 02:46:39,998
That reminds me.

2151
02:46:48,506 --> 02:46:49,716
Try it on.

2152
02:47:15,241 --> 02:47:16,743
How does it feel?

2153
02:47:19,329 --> 02:47:21,039
Like it's someone else's.

2154
02:47:24,084 --> 02:47:25,251
It isn't.

2155
02:47:38,598 --> 02:47:40,183
Thank you.

2156
02:47:41,893 --> 02:47:43,186
I'll do my best.

2157
02:47:48,566 --> 02:47:50,485
That's why it's yours.

2158
02:47:52,195 --> 02:47:53,571
You wanna tell me about her?

2159
02:48:00,161 --> 02:48:01,663
No.

2160
02:48:02,080 --> 02:48:04,207
No, I don't think I will.
